href="../2012/12/24/how-to-extend/">How to extend Grid Framework with your own methods</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-12-24">Published: 2012-12-24</time></p></header><p>Let's say you just bought Grid Framework, wrote some game logic and now you
want to reuse it. Wouldn't it be great if it was a class method in Grid
Framework so you could simply call it with one line of code? Even better, what
if you could have one method that has the same syntax for both rectangular and
hexagonal grids but different implementation based on the type of grid, so you
would have to write just one script for any type of grid? Luckily this is no
problem in Unity thanks to extension methods and if you have the code, then
wrapping it up into an extension method can de done in a few minutes. Take a
look at my latest video tutorial:</p><p><a href="../2012/12/24/how-to-extend/">Continue reading…</a></p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/12/17/hex-intro/">Hex Grid introduction video</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-12-17">Published: 2012-12-17</time></p></header><p>I made a short video giving you an overview of hex grids, so you can see them
right in action. I'll make a video on how to extend Grid Framework with your
own methods yourself next,</p><p><a href="../2012/12/17/hex-intro/">Continue reading…</a></p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/12/07/version-120-submitted/">Grid Framework version 1.2.0 submitted</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-12-07">Published: 2012-12-07</time></p></header><p>Just a quick update, version 1.2.0 has been submitted. This is your last chance
to buy the package for 15$, once it has been approved the price will be raised
to 20$.</p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/12/07/version-120/">Grid Framework version 1.2.0 released</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-12-07">Published: 2012-12-07</time></p></header><p>The wait is over, version 1.2.0 is out, bringing you the long promised hex
grids. I'll soon make a video demonstrating the new grid, in the meantime let
me explain it in words. My implementation brings you all the features you knew
from rectangular grids, except on a hex grid, and both grids inherit from the
same base class. This means the API for both is the same and you can write one
script for both grids with little to no need to make special adjustments for
different grid classes. Currently there is only one coordinate system and hex
grids have &quot;only&quot; as much functionality as rectangular grids. I wish to improve
upon this in the future.</p><p><a href="../2012/12/07/version-120/">Continue reading…</a></p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/11/30/version-1110/">Grid Framework version 1.1.10 released</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-11-30">Published: 2012-11-30</time></p></header><p>The 1.1.10 update brings in a new function, ScaleVector3(Vector scl) : Vector3
which takes in a vector and then scales it so it fits inside the grid. This is
similar to AlignVector3, which was introduced in the last update, to allow
performing the aligning and scaling without having to provide an actual
Transform.</p><p><a href="../2012/11/30/version-1110/">Continue reading…</a></p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/11/27/herring-for-lunch/">How about herring for lunch?</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-11-27">Published: 2012-11-27</time></p></header><p>Another progress update: <code>WorldToGrid</code> and <code>GridToWorld</code> are now implemented.
For those who don't know, those two functions convert a point's coordinates
from world space to grid space, the coordinate system used to locate points
relative to the grid's properties, and back. For rectangular grids it's a
fairly simple idea, the grid can be represented as a standard Cartesian
coordinate system.  With hex grids that won't do it, you simply cannot force a
hex grid into a Cartesian coordinate system, you need to find something else.
Fortunately there are several topologically identical possibilities with
easier, more intuitive coordinate systems. For the first release I have decided
to use the herringbone pattern:</p><p><a href="../2012/11/27/herring-for-lunch/">Continue reading…</a></p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/11/22/square-peg-in-round-hole/">Trying to fit a square peg into a hex hole</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-11-22">Published: 2012-11-22</time></p></header><p>The align feature has been giving me quite some headache lately. For small
objects it's easy, just fit them inside the nearest hex. It gets more
interesting once your object spans over more than one hex. Here is a screenshot

I was busy with exams, so development was slowed down and during the last

it's over I can get back to working on the hex grid update. Currently I'm about
halfway done, maybe more. I'll keep you updated :) Finally, I'd like to thank
everyone who bought Grid Framework so far, you guys have made all this effort
worthwhile and you are the ones who allow me to go on with it. Thank you.</p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/10/06/example-parsing/">Example video: Level Design and Text parsing in Unity3D</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-10-06">Published: 2012-10-06</time></p></header><p>I made another example video for Grid Framework, this time for the recently

a few lines of plain text and you get perfect clockwork-like precision. This

working and I added two more examples,  video tutorials will follow soon. I
also redid the screenshots because the Asset Store ate my old ones somehow.</p><p><a href="../2012/10/05/version-117/">Continue reading…</a></p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/10/02/cannot-log-in/">Cannot log into my account</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-10-02">Published: 2012-10-02</time></p></header><p>I've written two new examples, one that takes a plain text file and parses it
to create a breakout-style level based on a grid without changing the scene,
the other is a continuation of my grid-based movement example where I can place
obstacles on the grid and the sphere will not step on those squares (without
using any physics like collision and raycasts). Sadly I can't update Grid
Framework because I can't log into my account via Package Manager. My account
still works, I can log into the forums and my Publisher Administration, so the
problem must lie within the editor. I've submitted a bug report, but until then
I cannot publish updates. If you are interested in one of those two examples
please contact me over the Unity forums and I'll send you the examples,
provided that you already own Grid Framework. On a related note, it appears
that Grid Framework's product page in the Asset Store doesn't have any
screenshots. I did submit screenshots, but they don't appear for me, I don't
know if other people can't see them either.</p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/09/22/version-116/">Version 1.1.6 submitted</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-09-22">Published: 2012-09-22</time></p></header><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The classes Grid and RectGrid have been renamed to GFGrid

rendering. If you are wondering why this wasn't the case before, it was a
leftover from before the custom rendering range got implemented. Originally the
custom range was only meant for rendering because that would be what the layer
sees in the final game, not the drawing, whether they are the same or not.
Also, the drawing is only a drawing, the grid keeps working beyond what's
visible, being infinite. That's why the drawing had low priority and I worked
on other parts instead.</p></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="../2012/09/05/version-114/">Version 1.1.4 released</a></h1><header><p><time datetime="2012-09-05">Published: 2012-09-05</time></p></header><p>Version 1.1.4 has been approved. It doesn't add anything new for a change,

To do
this I will need to swap around variables so I can use the same formulae for
different cases. I could write the swapping part where it is needed, but then
I'd be writing the same thing several times (which is a bad thing to do).
Wouldn't it be better if there was some sort of swapping function? Could that
function work for any type of variable? Could it work without needing to
reassign variables again?

properly, either using simple lines or even Vectrosity. This is just the first
step though. Hex grids are very popular for games for various reasons, so it
makes perfect sense to do them next, right? Well, here is where the problem

demo scene so users could see an end setup. I thought dragging a script onto an
object is pretty straight-forward, but I agree, a demo scene would be a really
good idea. The tricky party is coming up with good ideas; don't get me wrong, I
have plenty of ideas for actual gameplay examples, but for a demo scene I need
something more basic and at the same time more catchy. I already made a little
sphere that randomly roams a grid face by face, stays within limits and

Again. Turns out that making an asset is only half the

in any of those fields, but I believe I did a pretty good job (well, maybe my
