Grid Framework has been approved and is from now available on the Unity Asset
Store for 15$

This is the price for the initial release, it will go up as the amount of
features increases, but all existing customers will get all updates for free.
Please feel free to visit the support thread and drop me a line if you have any
questions or suggestions. Once the first wave of purchases has passed and if
there are no issues I will start working on either hex grids or grid rendering,
whichever you guys might find more important.

And to think that is has already been four months since I started this blog...
the framework has gone quite a long way from a quick & dirty solution I rolled
up in two days to something I can proudly announce. I am looking forward to an
even brighter future for Grid Framework.
