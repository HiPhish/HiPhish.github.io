It's up, version 1.1.2 brings Vectrosity support, better documentation and
integrates Grid Framework into the menu bar. From now on you will never again
have to drag scripts manually from the Plugins folder onto objects when using
Grid Framework.

If you want to try the Vectrosity examples please uncomment the scripts. I had
them commented so they wouldn't give errors to customers who don't have
Vectrosity installed.
