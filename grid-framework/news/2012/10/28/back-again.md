I just wanted to drop a line saying I'm back to work. As I mentioned previously
I was busy with exams, so development was slowed down and during the last
couple of weeks I had to stop completely to concentrate on studies. Now that
it's over I can get back to working on the hex grid update. Currently I'm about
halfway done, maybe more. I'll keep you updated :) Finally, I'd like to thank
everyone who bought Grid Framework so far, you guys have made all this effort
worthwhile and you are the ones who allow me to go on with it. Thank you.
