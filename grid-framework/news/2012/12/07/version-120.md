title: Grid Framework version 1.2.0 released

The wait is over, version 1.2.0 is out, bringing you the long promised hex
grids. I'll soon make a video demonstrating the new grid, in the meantime let
me explain it in words. My implementation brings you all the features you knew
from rectangular grids, except on a hex grid, and both grids inherit from the
same base class. This means the API for both is the same and you can write one
script for both grids with little to no need to make special adjustments for
different grid classes. Currently there is only one coordinate system and hex
grids have "only" as much functionality as rectangular grids. I wish to improve
upon this in the future.

Phew, this has really exhausted me. Often times I was wondering what I had
gotten myself into and it was not uncommon for me to work beyond midnight,
pondering above pencil-drawings, deriving formulae and thinking how to make
everything work nice. The last stretch has been especially tiresome, getting
the computer to do something is one thing, but then you start putting together
the manual and you notice that the way it *how* it works doesn't feel right.
It's those little thing no one notices when they are done right but everyone
notices them when they are done wrong. What kept me pushing forward are you
guys and your support. Many of you are silent, and that's fine, but I know you
are there. Thank you.
