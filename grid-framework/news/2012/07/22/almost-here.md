title: Almost there...

Well, it's almost done. Again. Turns out that making an asset is only half the
job, you still need to hammer out any ugly dents, polish the thing and then
change your job to become a graphic designer, a video commentator, a writer and
a salesman! What good is the best asset if you present it in such a way that
makes people not even want to take a look? I'm not claiming that I'm an expert
in any of those fields, but I believe I did a pretty good job (well, maybe my
voice work for the video could use some improvements). In a way I'm glad the
old "images" I had prepared for the first version are now lost forever, that
was something to turn people away forever. You cannot imagine how awful those
looked.

Anyway, I finished the videos, I made the drawings for the asset store and I
wrote the documentation. The only things left now are uploading the videos
(which will take quite a while with my connection), writing a description text
for the asset store (shouldn't be too much, so it won't take too long) and then
sending the files over to Unity. In the meantime, please enjoy a small teaser:

Unfortunately clicking this won't do anything. Yet.
