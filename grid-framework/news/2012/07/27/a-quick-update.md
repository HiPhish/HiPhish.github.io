title: A quick update

I have been contacted by an Asset Store admin, who recommends me to include a
demo scene so users could see an end setup. I thought dragging a script onto an
object is pretty straight-forward, but I agree, a demo scene would be a really
good idea. The tricky party is coming up with good ideas; don't get me wrong, I
have plenty of ideas for actual gameplay examples, but for a demo scene I need
something more basic and at the same time more catchy. I already made a little
sphere that randomly roams a grid face by face, stays within limits and
immediately adapts to changes in the grid, all with just 32 lines of code total
(not counting whitespaces and comments). I'll come up with two or three more
nice demos, that should give a good impression of Grid Framework  in action.
