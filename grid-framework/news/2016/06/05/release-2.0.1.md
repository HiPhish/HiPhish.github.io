title: Grid Framework version 2.0.1 released
category: release
---

Version 2.0.1 fixes a bug where the custom inspector of the *Cylinder* renderer
for polar  grids  would  not show  up.  It would  instead  display  the default
inspector generated by Unity,  which was  still functional,  but ugly and would
expose things meant for scripting only.
