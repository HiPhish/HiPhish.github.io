		<!-- Content of the article -->
		<p>After almost half  a year in  the making  Grid Framework  version 2.0  has been
released on the Unity <a class="reference external" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/62498">Asset Store</a>. This is the first major release since the
initial launch  and will make Grid Framework  easier to use,  more powerful and
more flexible with no extra performance overhead.  Being a major version update
this breaks compatibility  with the version 1.x releases,  but an upgrade guide
is included in  the user manual.  If you  still cannot  upgrade to  2.0 you can
still keep using 1.x, but the old releases will not be getting any new features
anymore.</p>
<p>Version 1.x  has been  deprecated on  the Asset Store,  which means  you can no
longer purchase it,  but you  can still  access it if  you purchased it  in the
past. All existing customers  can get a free upgrade to version 2.0,  it really
is that much better.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-new">
<h2>What is new</h2>
<p>The changes are too many to list as a simple changelog,  almost all of the code
has been refactored. I will give you the highlights instead.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Separate grids and rederers</dt>
<dd><p class="first">In the past a grid has had many jobs:  be a grid, convert coordinates,  show
the  grid  and possibly  even  more. This lead  to very  few but  very large
classes with a  large public API.  It was hard  for users to  find what they
were looking for and hard from me to maintain.</p>
<p class="last">The  tasks  have  now  been  split  up:  Grids are  just grids  and  convert
coordinates while designated renderer  classes are responsible for computing
how to display the grids. There can be more than one renderer type for every
grid, such as the different shapes of hex grids. This leads to more classes,
but every class is much smaller than the one big class it originates from.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A leaner and cleaner API</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Some features had  been added to  Grid Framework because  they seemed handy,
but while  re-evaluating  the framework  I found  that a  lot  of  them were
redundant of leftovers from previous  releases that had been kept in for the
sake of compatibility. Take for examples <code>size</code> and <code>renderFrom</code>/<code>renderTo</code>,
the  <code>size</code>  is  really  just a  special case  of setting  <code>renderFrom</code> and
<code>renderTo</code> to the same value with opposite sign.</p>
<p class="last">This is just confusing and adds no real value for the user. If something can
be  fully  replicated with  one or  two  lines  of code  and no  overhead it
shouldn't be part of the framework. A major release is a good opportunity to
throw out the old stuff.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Official extension methods</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Throwing redundant  API out  is easy,  but what  about API that  is actually
useful but does  not really fit  the nature of  the class?  Take for example
<code>AlignTransform</code>:  aligning objects is very useful and not too trivial,  but
it does  not really  belong in  the grid  class.  The C#  language  offers a
feature for this: extension methods.</p>
<p class="last">Extension methods need to be explicitly imported,  but they are used just as
if they were methods of  the class they extend.  Grid Framework comes with a
number of useful standard extension methods grouped by task. You will now be
able to find what you are looking for much faster.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A flexible rendering pipeline</dt>
<dd><p class="first">In version 1.x the  rendering process has been  mostly "magic" where you set
the values of the  grid and then lines appear.  In version 2.0 the rendering
now passes through a number of stages  and you can intercept any of them and
take full control over the process from there.</p>
<p class="last">Of course if  you don't need  that you can  leave things as  they are and it
will just work as it did before.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Events fired by grids</dt>
<dd><p class="first">We are now making use  of the C# ability to use  messages on certain events,
i.e. when the  properties of a grid change.  This allows you to only do work
when something has happened instead of having to poll the grid constantly.</p>
<p class="last">This feature is used by renderers to only update the lines when the grid has
actually changed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Namespaces over prefixes</dt>
<dd>Older  versions  of Unity  had  trouble with  <code>MonoBehaviour</code>  subclasses in
custom namespaces, forcing me to prefix every class with <code>GF</code>. Because Unity
versions less than 5 are no longer  supported the prefix has been dropped in
favour of finely grained namespaces.</dd>
<dt>Write your own</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Splitting up  large classes  has a  very pleasant  side effect:  you can now
write  your  own grids,  renderers  and  extension methods.  This  makes  it
possible the extend the framework  to your particular needs just the way you
need it.</p>
<p class="last">For version 2.0 the protected  properties of classes are documented as well,
you now  have exactly  the same  power over the  framework as  I do  without
having to modify the original.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Unified directory</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Last but not least,  all of Grid Framework is now contained in one directory
in your project. T here is nothing to clutter up your project anymore thanks
to improvements to the engine in Unity 5 now that I was able to drop support
for Unity 4.</p>
<p class="last">In  particular  this means  that the  <em>WebPlayerTemplates</em>  directory is  no
longer  being  abused  to  stop  Unity  from compiling  JavaScript  files as
UnityScript.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>File size comparison</h2>
<p>When I originally announced the major version update I was looking at the sizes
of the classes in terms of lines of code. Here is the old chart:</p>

<p>Even if we ignore the comments these classes are huge,  especially <code>GFHexGrid</code>.
How do the new grids fare in comparison?</p>

<p>The biggest reduction is in the abstract <code>Grid</code> class which is the basis of all
grids.  The massive reduction comes from  factoring out the rendering task into
the new flexible  pipeline and the removal  of a lot of redundant API.  At this
point <code>Grid</code> is just a skeleton of private and protected members.</p>
<p><code>HexGrid</code> has had more  than half of its  code removed,  the largest part of it
was the different ways  to render a hex grid which  are now individual renderer
classes.  The class is still quite large though, because of the many coordinate
systems it has. However, factoring out the coordinate system conversions out of
grids would remove all functionality out of them.</p>
<p>The other grids  have had less  code reduction because  they were already quite
small,  the  large  API  was  mostly  just  inherited  from  the parent  class.
<code>PolarGrid</code> has had  a nice reduction  because a lot of  conversions have  been
made into extension methods.</p>
<p>If you are wondering  why I have more lines  of comments than actual code,  the
reason is  that the  API documentation  is written  inside the  source files as
special comments.  On top of that the proper  way of writing API comments is to
use XML  syntax.  Doxygen can use  other styles  of comments,  but last  time I
checked only XML comments would show up in MonoDevelop during auto completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-to-go-from-here">
<h2>Where to go from here</h2>
<p>As far as features are  concerned I think Grid Framework is very complete.  I'm
still open to suggestions,  but I don't  have any concrete  plans for now.  The
next step is to  step up my presentation,  the introduction video is still from
the initial release and the screenshots are very crude to put it nicely. I also
need  a  better  looking  logo,  made  with  vectors  preferably.  I have  been
experimenting with different illustration software,  but none had to ability to
generate a  nice regular grid,  I need some programmatic solution.  <a class="reference external" href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a> can
generate vector graphics from code, so I'll try to look into that.</p>
<p>I would  also  like  to replace  the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.doxygen.nl">Doxygen</a>-generated  documentation  with  a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/">Sphinx</a>-based one.  Doxygen is great for extracting documentation comments from
source files,  but the HTML  output is very rigid.  Sphinx lets  me use  <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org">Jinja</a>
templates,  which is something I am already using for this website.  This would
require a C#  domain for Sphinx,  something I have been working on on the side,
but it is nowhere near useful yet.</p>
<p>Another thing I would  like to do is port Grid Framework  to engines other than
Unity. With version 2.0 the codebase is in a state that is clean enough that it
could be re-written  in another language.  I'm not announcing anything yet,  so
don't hold your breath too long :)</p>
<p>If you have made  it this far thank  you for reading and  I hope you will enjoy
the improvements.  If you like the  product please  leave a review,  and if you
don't like it tell  me so I can make it better.  Don't forget that you can have
your games showcased on my website as well,  I really want to see what you make
with Grid Framework.</p>
