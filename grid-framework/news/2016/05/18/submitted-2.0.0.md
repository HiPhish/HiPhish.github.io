title: Version 2.0.0 has been submitted
category: progress
---

One of the hardest  tasks when creating something is actually shipping it,  but
it's finally time now,  version 2.0 has  been submitted to the  Asset Store for
review.  After  some  last-minute  changes here  and there,  fixing  typos  and
re-adjusting screenshots I think we are good to go.  I still have to figure out
how to set up the Upgrade option in the Asset Store, but it can't be that hard.
The submission  process officially takes  between five to ten working days,  so
hopefully the new version will be up soon.
