Grid Framework version 1.5.2 has just been approved of by the Asset Store team.
This release is a bugfix for polar grids where the cylindrical lines have not
been calculated properly if the depth of the grid was not 1.

Another thing you might notice is that the engine requirements have been
knocked down to Unity version 3.5.7, the latest release of Unity 3. While Grid
Framework has always been compatible with Unity 3, I have been using Unity 4
for deployment so far. Now the compatibility with Unity 3 is official.

Compatibility with Unity 5 is coming with the next update; it's nothing major,
but some of the examples did not compile due to deprecated properties.
