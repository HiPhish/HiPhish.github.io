Grid Framework version 1.5.3 has been approved by the Asset Store team. This
release brings compatibility with the upcoming Unity 5.

Grid Framework itself was compatible, but a number of examples used properties
that have been removed in Unity 5. Those are properties that secretly called
GetComponent, but looked like regular variables.

And while I'm at it, here is a little teaser for the next feature update:
