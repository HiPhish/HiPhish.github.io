title: Grid Framework version 1.2.4 released
tags: old-blog
category: release
---

Version 1.2.4 has been approved by the Asset Store team. Here are the new
features:

- a caching feature that keeps the activity of the garbage collector low now,
  instead of re-calculating the end points of lines every frame we can re-use
  them instead as long as the grid hasn't been modified.
- a new example shows you how to create seemingly endless grids without the
  overhead of actually having a gigantic grid
- explanations about rendering performance in the user manual

Enjoy the new performance improvement and thank you for your support.
