title: Grid Framework version 1.3.4 released
tags: old-blog
category: release

This is a small update, it adds the ability to offset the origin of the grid.
It also adds a chapter to the manual about extending Grid Framework with your
own code. There is nothing in there experienced .NET user wouldn't know, but I
figure some user might not know about extension methods and might do things in
a hacky way, so I added the chapter to it, along with example code.
