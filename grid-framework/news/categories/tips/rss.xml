feature that will keep the Garbage Collector from going crazy. Until now
rendering always went like this: Manager requests rendering from grid -&amp;gt; grid
calculates the end points of each line -&amp;gt; these points get passed to Unity's GL
class for rendering. Every single frame. I have introduced a caching feature
that will store all the calculated points and reuse them instad of calculating
everything all over again as long as the grid has not been modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still doesn't solve the second bottleneck: rendering all these lines.
Unfortunately there just isn't anything I can do about this, the GL class needs
to have every single point one way or another. So, what if you want a very
large grid that extends way beyond your camera's view? The answer is to fake
it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to only have the grid large enough to go beyond the camera's view
port. Once the camera tries to go off the grid change the grid's rendering
range to fit into the view port again. However, every time we change the
rendering range this causes the caching to recalculate the points (since our
old points are no longer valid), so caching doesn't do anything. The solution
here is to add a little buffer, to make the grid larger than the view port, so
we can move the camera a bit without going off the grid. Here is the video
showing it step by step:&lt;/p&gt;

the concept is there if you need it for larger cases. This example will work in
the current version of Grid Framework, but caching is a feature of the upcoming
version 1.2.4, which is still waiting for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

want to reuse it. Wouldn't it be great if it was a class method in Grid
Framework so you could simply call it with one line of code? Even better, what
if you could have one method that has the same syntax for both rectangular and
hexagonal grids but different implementation based on the type of grid, so you
would have to write just one script for any type of grid? Luckily this is no
problem in Unity thanks to extension methods and if you have the code, then
wrapping it up into an extension method can de done in a few minutes. Take a
look at my latest video tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="youtube youtube-16x9"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" seamless="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_QteDtqHK4"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extension methods are only available in C#, but once you've written the method
you can use it in any of Unity's scripting languages. Aside from keeping your
code cleaner, extension methods have the advantage that if you need to make
adjustments to your game logic you only need to do it in one place and every
call of the method benefits from it.&lt;/p&gt;
