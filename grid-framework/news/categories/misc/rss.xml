Unity has been MonoDevelop. While it is a good IDE for the most part it
suffered from a number of annoying issues, such as folds randomly opening, poor
performance, and auto completion randomly not working. Your mileage may vary,
and for the most parts it was doing its job, but the annoying hiccups kept
happening all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried out the official Xamarin Studio, but that one didn't fare better and on
top of that always threw up error messages when opening a file. I was looking
into alternate editors, but they didn't offer the rich C#-focused feature set
of MonoDevelop, so I was stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I was so fed up, I decided to go all the way back: no fancy IDEs, no
GUIs, back to to bare basics: Vim. The cool thing about Vim is that's it's a
very simple barebones editor that can be extended and customised to your
liking. Vanilla Vim is nice, but you have not really used Vim until you have
tailored every aspect to your personal liking. That's a gradual process that
will take years of experience, but I do already feel very comfortable outside
of the hand-holding restrictions of the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an ideal Unity setup you will want a GUI client of Vim, such as MacVim.
That doesn't mean that Vim will get all those fancy buttons and menus, although
you can enable those if you want to, but the main advantage is that it can be
launched like any other application instead of through the terminal. MacVim has
also better mouse support (it's faster to resize windows with the mouse) and
the character cursor looks different in insert mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing you want is support for .Net and C# features. The plugin for
that is Omnisharp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim"&gt;https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omnisharp will add pretty much all features that you have come to love from
MonoDevelop, without the headache. Omnisharp also provides an interface for
other plugins, for example you can use it with YouCompleteMe to get automatic
code-completion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe"&gt;https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a ton of other useful plugins out there as well and some are listed on
Omnisharp's page. Another advantage of Vim is that it's not restricted to one
particular language or framework. You can easily write your essay or design
your HTML web page in it. Customisations can be set for each file type
differently or you can use them over multiple types. Since it's all one editor
you don't have to learn a new IDE for every project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I have been designing my new upcoming website in Vim as well, the same
editor I use for writing Grid Framework. How cool is that? Here is a video I
found on YouTube of someone using Vim to edit text with the speed of though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="left" class="youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lQNFfhC4QI8" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2015-01-09:grid-framework/news/2015/01/09/hello-vim/</guid><category>old-blog</category><category>rant</category></item><item><title>Whitelisting subdirectories in Git</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2014/09/09/whitelisting-in-git/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After having migrated the development of Grid Framework to Git I wanted to set
it up to track only certain sub-directories. I turned out that whitelisting is
quite tricky, so here is how I did it for people who might run into the same
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll use only one .gitignore file and it will be placed in the root of our
repository, which is also the root of our project. We can do the usual
blacklisting stuff like blacklisting ceretain file types and directories, but
the Assets directory is where it gets tricky. Since the directory contains all
sorts of other plugins used during development but not worth tracking, we can
neither black- nor whitelist the entire directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we'll blacklist all the contents of the Assets directory. Note that this
does not blacklist the directory itself, just its contents, but since Git
operates on files the effect is the same. The difference is that blacklisting
an entire directory prevents us from ever whitelisting any of its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
Assets/*
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can whitelist a subdirectory and its meta file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
!Assets/Grid\ Framework/
!Assets/Grid\ Framework.meta
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple enough, but what if we want to whitelist only a specific subdirectory of
a subdirectory? The Editor directory contains code from other plugins as well,
so we don't want to track the entire thing. In this case we need to repeat the
same process as above but one level deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
!Assets/Editor/
!Assets/Editor.meta
Assets/Editor/*
!Assets/Editor/Grid\ Framework/
!Assets/Editor/Grid\ Framework.meta
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we whitelist the Editor directory, then we immediately blacklist its
contents and whitelist a specific subdirectory. This way none of the other
editor extensions will be tracked. We can repeat the same process for the
Plugins directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
!Assets/Plugins/
!Assets/Plugins.meta
Assets/Plugins/*
!Assets/Plugins/Grid\ Framework/
!Assets/Plugins/Grid\ Framework.meta
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, you do have to repeat all these steps for every level of
subdirectories. You don't have to whitelist subdirectories of already
whitelisted directories, so any subdirectory in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Assets/Editor/Grid\
Framework/&lt;/tt&gt; is already tracked. Also note the backslash in the path, it is
necessay to escape the space character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Whitelisted the Unity meta files of whitelisted folders as well,
just in case. Of course if you are not using Unity you need to figure out if
and what meta files you have instead and if they need to be tracked as well.&lt;/p&gt;

with some much-needed cleanup. While I'm still waiting for approval I have been
working on a new feature for rectangular grids that I had wanted to do for
quite a while now, but couldn't until the cleanup: I'm talking about shearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of sheared grid" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2014/08/24/shearing/images/shearing.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an un-rotated rectangular grid with skewed axes to create the popular
2:1 isometric look. This is quite powerful, because it allows for isometric 2D
graphics to be used with Grid Framework. Getting an isometric look in a 3D game
is very simple, you just rotate the camera until it looks right. However, in a
2D game the camera has to be perpendicular to the image plane and objects are
just drawn as if they were at an angle, so rotation is out of question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shearing is fully implemented, I just need to write the documentation for it.
It works with arbitrary numbers and for all axes along any other axis, so you
can shear your grids any way you want. It will be a feature for the 1.5 update
once the upcoming 1.4.2 release gets approved.&lt;/p&gt;

what I am currently at. The good news is that the new coordinate systems have
been implemented and are ready to use. Of course there is still the obligatory
last check to do, but i expect everything to be fine. All methods that got the
axe are now gone as well and have been put into extension methods and ZIPped
into archives; that way no one will accidently use the deprecated API. I also
added a section called Legacy Support to the manual with instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the promised rant. I have transitioned all the documentation to
Doxygen, both scripting reference and user manual. Now all that would be left
would be to sprinkle some CSS fairy dust on top of it so it looks nice and I'm
done. Except editing the CSS is an exercise in pure trial &amp;amp; error frustration,
there is no documentation for it and the code is barely commented. The manual
is a pain in the butt as well, it's like it was written for people who already
know how to use Doxygen. It will go into detail about all the possible ways of
formating my text, but it doesn't explain how to get the text into the manual
in a specific order. Don't worry, I got it all covered now, but it was not a
fun journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to slim down the default HTML design, because I think the large header
buttons at the top are too large and vibrant, but I've had it with Doxygen.
Don't get me wrong, it's a great system and I'm sure everything made perfect
sense when wrting it, but it is obscure from the outside. Anyway, I'm going to
stick with the default design for now, but at least I limited the size of
images so they don't disrupt the flow of the text. There probably won't be any
PDF documentation anymore though, the HTML is more flexible to read and
navigate, plus the PDF generated by Doxygen looks rather... ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I've got everything out of the way it's time to wrap it up and
hopefully get it released next week.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2013-08-02:grid-framework/news/2013/08/02/status-update/</guid><category>old-blog</category><category>rant</category></item><item><title>What's up next?</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/07/19/whats-up-next/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, I decided to do a status update so you know what's going on and
coming next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="two-new-examples"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two new examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example is something I wanted to do for quite a while, it generates a
terrain mesh like the terrain in games like SimCity from a plain text file. You
provide the numbers for the height of vertices and the mesh gets created. On
top of that you can click a vertex to raise it and right-click to lower. All
the vertices will be placed along the vertices of the grid, so the level
designer doesn't have to wory about the layout of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example is a rotary phone dial using polar grids, it's based on a
suggestion by a customer (I always appreciate input, don't be shy ^^). You have
a rotary dial, you click it and then it rotates like a real dial, depending on
which number you clicked. It may no look very impressive on its own, but the
template could be used for all kinds of cool UI displays and menus. It works by
checking which sector of the grid was clicked and then multiplying that with
the angle of the grid and then applying the rotation over time.
Both examples are already done and will definitely be part of the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-hexagonal-coordinate-systems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New hexagonal coordinate systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main feature of the upcoming update. Up until now the only
coordinate system hex grids had was the herringbone pattern. It's easy to
understand, but when writing for it you often have to differentiate between odd
and even X-coordinate, which is... stupid. The new coordinate systems don't
have that problem, but they are harder to understand, so pick your poison ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first coordinate system is "rhombic", meaning the X-axis is rotated 30°
upwards. This removes the need for the even/odd cases, but now moving
south-west is actually moving west. The second coordinate system is "cubic", it
uses three axes in two dimensions. To understand it remember the game Qbert,
the game world is in 3D with cubes, but the actual graphics are in 2D and the
cubes are actually hexagons. Finally, we have barycentric coordinates for the
more mathematically inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want this feature to be done before going after playmaker support. I
know you guys want Playmaker and I keep telling you "later", but this is more
urgent. The good news is that these coordiante systems turned out to be much
less painful to implement than I originally expected. I still need to give
everything the final polish and make sure the systems are not only
mathematically correct, but also make sense to a human being, so I'm about 90%
done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-documentation-with-doxygen"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New documentation with doxygen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now I have been writing the documentation in Pages and exporting it as
PDF. It was an OK workflow and the results looked reasonably well, but as Grid
Framework's API grew it became more and more of a pain to write the actual
documentation with all the cross-references and unified layout and styles. I
have now reached the point where it would be just madness to continue, so I
decided to switch to Doxygen. When you use Doxygen you comment your source code
in a specific manner, then Doxygen parses it and uses your comments to document
all the methods for a human to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition phase is ugly, I need to copy-paste or rewrite all my
documentation, but once it's done any future updates will be much easier. This
also means you will get documentation in both HTML and PDF format from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="vertex-matrix-gets-the-axe"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vertex matrix gets the axe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some not-so-good news. I have been thinking about this for a while,
and the vertex matrix methods were never really good. The idea was to give you
a quick and simple way to store some vertices of a grid in an array and be able
to read them, but the way I did it is way too specific. It will only be useful
in a handful of cases. This leaves me with two options: either expand on it,
writing many variants of the method and on top of that doing the same thing for
faces, boxes and edges, or just cut it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to cut it out, because there is no point in dragging all that code
along, when most people will never use it and some will only use a fraction of
it. It would be much easier and better if the users themselves wrote their own
methods, it's less than ten lines of code anyway and you get full control over
what you want. You don't have to drag along an array that's four times larger
than you need. When looking at the examples I wrote, not even I used the vertex
matrix methods once, because it was easier and cleaner just to roll it from
scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally this raises another concern, what about the people who were using
this method? I can't just rip it out and tell them to write it themselves. This
is where extension methods come into play: After I removed the methods I put
them back into and extension method in a separate file, which I ZIPed. If you
need the vertex matrix methods back just unzip it and you won't notice any
difference. Of course if enough people actually want the vertex matrix to stay
in place I'll put it back, but if no one objects this will be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2013-07-19:grid-framework/news/2013/07/19/whats-up-next/</guid><category>old-blog</category><category>progress</category><category>API-change</category></item><item><title>CheckComponent()</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/07/03/check-component/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick but handy tip. Recently I found myself needing to reference
various components in my script without knowing if they exist. I have to get
the component and then check if it exists, and if not add it to prevent null
exceptions. Here is what you would write in such a case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
MeshCollider mc = GetComponent&amp;lt;MeshCollider&amp;gt;();
if (!mc)
    mc = gameObject.AddComponent&amp;lt;MeshCollider&amp;gt;();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we get the component and store it in a variable, then if it is null we
add the component to the object. Simple, right? True, but if you need to do
this several times it can get messy. You can copy-paste it once with a
different type, but it gets tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately we can call generics to the rescue! Let's wrap it all up into one
generic function that works on any component:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
private T CheckComponent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;() where T: Component {
    T component = GetComponent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();
    if (!component)
        component = gameObject.AddComponent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();
    return component;
}

MeshCollider mc = CheckComponent&amp;lt;MeshCollider&amp;gt;();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it is important for the type T to inherit from Component or else the
methods GetComponent and AddComponent don't make any sense and will throw
errors. We can take this even one step further by making CheckCompnent an
extension method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public static class ComponentExtensions {
    public static T CheckComponent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(this Component theComponent) where T: Component {
        T component = theComponent.GetComponent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();
        if (!component)
            component = theComponent.gameObject.AddComponent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();
        return component;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can call CheckComponent as if it were a part of Unity's standard API,
just like GetComponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
// use this in any of your scripts:
MeshCollider mc = CheckComponent&amp;lt;MeshCollider&amp;gt;();
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'm done with all the features. Now I need some last polish and I must prepare
new images for the Asset Store, then it's all good to go. So, what took me so
long? Well, designing and writing code is one thing, then you have to put it to
use This often reveals weak points, some things might seems counter-intuitive,
or some things are more complicated to use than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example would be making an object rotate as it moves through the grid so
it's always facing outwards. Sure, you can do it using the existing API to
convert through coordiante systems, extract the angle of the object relative to
the grid's Z-axis and then use Unity's built in math functions to create the
quaternion by rotating x degrees around the grid's Z-axis. That doesn't sound
pleasant at all. That's why now you can just call the World2Rotation method to
get the quaternion directly, then you can do whatever you want with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delayed the release a bit but such small additions can make a big
difference in the end. Another thing worth noting is that this release has been
written in Unity 4 and as such it will list Unity 4 as the required version in
the Asset Store. Unity 4 has been out for half a year now, but even if you
still want to stick with Unity 3 you shouldn't have any problems as I didn't
use any Unity 4 exclusive API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's it for now, thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2013-06-09:grid-framework/news/2013/06/09/feature-freeze-polar/</guid><category>old-blog</category><category>progress</category></item><item><title>Polar grid drawing refined</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/05/26/polar-drawing/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time I showed a preview of polar grids it was a full cycle starting from
the origin containing all layers up to the edge. During runtime if only part of
the grid is visible to the player rendering the whole thing can be a waste of
resources, that's why you have the option of specifying a specific rendering
range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying out several approaches of interpreting the rectangular range, but
in the end I went for a polar approach. What does this mean? You have two
Vector3 values, one called renderFrom, the other called renderTo. The
x-coordinate tells what radius to start and end at, the y-coordinate gives us
the starting and ending angle and the z-coordinate gives us the starting and
ending layer. Here is an example of what if can look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/05/26/polar-drawing/images/polar-refined.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only limitations are that the starting radius cannot be less than 0 and
starting values cannot be larger than ending values (and vice-versa). The only
exception is the angle, this is is necessary in order to  be able to draw a
sector from, let's say 300° to 15° (which can be seen as from 300° to 375°).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the biggest roadblock so far, now I need to do some proper
testing and final polish, write the new documentation and I can submit the
update to Unity. Supporting a new type of grid is a substantial effort and,
since everything is interconnected, it usually requires going through the code
for the other grids as well. Sometimes parts that seemed general enough might
need to be overridden and other parts that seemed very specific become more
general and need to be moved up the hierarchy. Considering this and the updates
since the release of version 12.0 I believe raising the price to from 20$ to
25$ is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as usual, if you already bought Grid Framework all updates are free
for you. If you intend to buy Grid Framework, now is the chance to still get it
for the lower price. You don't need to rush and get it immediately though, I'll
post an at least one more update before I submit version 1.3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, thank you for your support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiPhish&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates"&gt;polar
grid&lt;/a&gt; is based on polar
coordinates, meaning instead of identifying a point's position using X and Y
coordinates we use a radius and an angle. The radius tells us how far from the
origin the point is and the angle tells us the direction. This screenshot shows
the new polar grid in Unity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/05/10/first-look-polar/images/polar.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polar grid is defined by three values: radius, sectors and depth. Radius
refers to how far apart the red circles in the picture are, sectors is how many
sectors you have and depth is how far apart each two layers of a polar grid
are. Since we have a third dimension the mathematically correct term would be a
"&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system"&gt;cylindrical
grid&lt;/a&gt;", but I'll
call it polar just for the sake of simplicity. If you have cylindrical
coordinates just ignore the third component and you get polar coordinates.
You'll notice that the angle between sectors does not define the grid, because
the sectors have to cover the grid completely; you can't have the last sector
be only a third of the other sectors. I'll see if I can still make the angle
adjustable via an accessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar grids have a few unique quirks that differentiate them from rectangular
and hex grids. First of all we now have circles instead of straight lines, but
we can't draw actual circles. My solution is to add a "smoothing" option;
without smoothing the red lines inside the sectors will be all straight and the
grid will look like a spider's web, but each increase in smoothing breaks up
the line into more segments, coming closer to a round shape. Of course
increasing the smoothing means that there will be more points to calculate, but
fortunately a single-digit number is already enough to get a smooth look. Also,
the more sectors you have, the less smoothing you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more fundamental issue rather than just a cosmetic concern is the coordinate
systems. Yes, plural. The first one is the regular cylindrical coordinate
system where radius, angle and height are given as absolute from the origin
with respect to world dimensions. This means, no matter what you set your
grid's radius, sectors or depth to, a given point will always have the same
coordinates. The other one is a grid coordinate system where each component
represents the relative position inside the grid with respect to radius, angle
(calculated from sectors) and depth. Changing the grid also changes the
coordinates of a given point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can convert between both coordinate systems and world space on the fly and
neither system is really "better" than the other. It would be just wrong to
have a polar grid without polar coordinates and it is what you want to use when
moving objects in the world. On the other hand, it you want to think in "grid
space", it's easier to think in terms of fields, like a board game, so grid
coordiantes appear more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point all the math is done and the hardest to implement methods
(drawing, coordinate transformation and finding nearest vertex/face/box in all
three coordinate systems) have been written. The next parts should be easier to
implement, but I'm not exactly sure how to design them (what exactly does
"aligning" in a polar grid even mean?). I'll keep you updated once I have more
to show.&lt;/p&gt;

properties in Unity and how to make them work properly. Properties are a C#
feature and not available in UnityScript (another reason to ditch UnityScript).
To help demonstrate what I mean I will be using a "circle" class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-are-properties"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are properties?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see radius is public and there is nothing stopping someone from
putting in nonsensical values like negative numbers. Since we are in Euclidean
geometry there is no such thing as "anti-length" and we need some way to
restrict the value of radius to positive numbers. One solution would be to make
radius a pivate member and use getters and setters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;SetRadius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mathf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;GetRadius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(the underscore in front of radius is there to mark it as a member variable;
it's just a convention, not mandatory) This gets the job done, but it's ugly
and bloats the syntax. What we need instead is some sort of variable/function
hybrid that acts like a messenger. This is where properties come in. Here is
the same code as above, except using properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mathf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property looks like a function that missing the brackets for parameters and
it is treated like a variable in coding. Whenever we assign a value to it by
using the "=" sign we actually call the set and when we use it in computation
we call the get. value always refers to the value on the right hand side of the
"=" sign. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;myCircle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//calls set and sets _radius to 0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;myCircle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//calls get and returns 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-should-you-use-properties"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why should you use properties?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see accessors allow us to expose member variables in a controlled
fashion. You can put up restrictions on what a certain variable can hold. You
can also create read-only "variables" by omitting the set part. Let's say your
circle class has several formulae using the circumference and you don't want to
type the formula every time. Here is what it would look like using an accessor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mathf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;circumference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mathf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a "circumference" variable, instead its value is
computed on the fly, yet you can still use it as if it were an actual variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;volume&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;myCircle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;circumference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unity handes rotation using quaternions but you can still use Euler angles in
the editor and in scripting, this is (most likely) the result of using
properties as well. Properties are also great for exposing member variables in
custom inspectors, like I did or Grid Framework. Unfortunately there is a
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="member-varibles-and-the-editor"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Member varibles and the editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can treat the property just like any other variable when writing a custom
inspector. However, once you hit play you will notice that your values have
been reset and once you exit play mode or change the scene or anything else
your values reset again. This is because the properties cannot actually store
anything, they just serve to expose private members. The values of private
members don't stick though, that's why everything gets reset. The solution is
to use [SerializeField]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;    [SerializeField]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mathf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;circumference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mathf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it, now your member variable will get serialized and will be remembered.
It took me a while to find this, but I was finally able to throw out quite a
lot of ugly workarounds. And now there is no reason not to use properties
anymore. Let's end this post by using properties to limit the value of a float
variable to something appropriate for angles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_angle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;angle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_angle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This has been quite a year for me, so what better
opportunity to recap the birth process and evolution of Grid and set the plans
for this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-it-all-began"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it all began&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I was sitting at my computer, trying to place blocks in Unity, thinking
how great it would be if there was some sort of extension, a framework if you
will, that would auto snap objects to a grid of my choice. Unity already has
some form of grid built in, but it's rather poor to say the least.
Unfortunately a quick Google search didn't yield anything useful, so was left
waiting for someone who knew how to program a copmputer to make such an
extension. Then it struck me: I am someone and I know how to program a
computer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-first-draft"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The first draft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I sat down, took out some pen and paper and started deriving th formulae.
After a while I had a plan and I wrote a nice simple makeshift solution. It
worked but in my head all sorts of great ideas popped up. What if the grid was
in 3D and could be rotated? Would it be possible not to just align objects but
construct an entire coordinate system out of it? What if the origin of the grid
was not the origin of the world but any point in space? Would it be possible to
have more than one grid in the scene? How about entirely different grid shapes
than just squares? And if all that was possible, wouldn't be possible to use
the grid for more than just aliging? Could the grid be used for actual
gameplay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea at the time was to get the makeshift solution polished up a bit and
then give it away for free and ask for a small donation or sell if really
cheaply. This idea was humble, if you want to be nice, or stupid, if you want
to be realistic. Essentially, it wouldn't have made any user happy nor would it
have made me money. No one would win. Fortunately the Asset Store submission
got lost somehow and remembering the awful drawings I had for the Asset Store
pictures, it really was for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="this-time-for-real"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Time For Real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson I leared was that if you want to do something do it either right or
don't do it at all. People will remember a halfassed effort and you will never
be able to shake it off. Instead I decided to get serious this time, I switched
my language from JavaScript to C#, dug into the deepest depths of the Unity
documentation and learned many new things along the way. At times it was
infuriating, at times it was fantastic and at times it was plain boring.
Nonetheless, if I had the chance to travel back in time I wouldn't do anything
differently (except for some lessons I had to learn the hard way), the
experience alone of crafting something on your own and working towards a goal
is very rewarding. I don't think there was anything left from the first draft,
and even if it was it is all gone by now. Good riddance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it had been just the coding part it would have been enough already. Being a
one man team however, I also had to write the documentation, design a logo,
create the Asset Store promotional material and write descriptions for the
Store and the forum thread. I never learned anything about marketing, but I did
work in retail, this is where my exerience came in handy. On the internet I can
think all day about the description text, but when it comes to talking face to
face with real people your brain has to act very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-first-release"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The First Release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to ask me what the hardest part was, I would say finishing it.
There comes a point when you have to draw the line and stop adding new features
so you can iron out the remaining bugs and wrap up the lose ends. There were
still some left after the release though, mainly the integration into Unity's
interface, no cusom inspectors for the grid classes and the complete lack of
rendering. I decided to tackle those as quickly as possible, for I was running
out of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-1-1-x-line"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 1.1.x Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how to do the rendering and at one point I was considering
imitating Vectrosity's behaviour (after asking for permission of course).
Anyone who owns Vectrosity and who has taken a look at the code will be blown
away by all the work of the author, there was no way I could just rip out some
parts and call it a day. Instead I decided to write my own rendering solution
and offer Vectrosity support as an option, since I already had a license and
the two looked like a perfect fit. Both solutions work in fundamentally
different ways, so users can choose the one they like best. Yay for choice ^^&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting rendering, the biggest missing feature, and Vectrosity support
out I had two things to do: many small improvements like a custom rendering
range or additional functions and of course hex grids. This was during the
summer when I was busy studying for exams, so my work on Grid Framework slowed
down to a crawl after the first few 1.1.x releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="version-1-2-x-and-hex-grids"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Version 1.2.x and hex grids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the exams I was finally able to devote time to Grid Framework again. The
hardest part about hex grids was not so much the math, although that wasn't
easy either, but how many possibilities there are to do hex grids. I already
discussed this topic a few months ago, but this was a real pain. It was clear I
wouldn't write several classes, so I had to design my code to accommodate for
all the cases. In the end the solution was not really hard, it was the journey
there, I just couldn't find anything on the internet or in any book about how
to do it. What really matters in the end though, is that I was able to deliver
one class for all cases, fitting right with my design principles established in
the first release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Grid Framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's it for last year, but what can you expect for 2013? First of all,
I'm working on my own website, so far it has only been this blog and the forum
thread, but I would like to give Grid Framework a proper web presence. I had to
learn HTML and CSS from scratch, but the site is almost done, just a few
finishing touches and it should be up soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hex grids have the same feature set as rectangular grids, but there is more we
can do with them, most notably more coordinate systems. Expect more updates for
hex grids after the site has launched. There are also a few minor features I
would like to get done all across Grid Framework, so I'll add them inbetween
the more important releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triangular grids and path finding are next on the priority list, I just haven't
decided which one would be more important. Triangular grids sound easier, but
path finding seems more useful. I'll have to think this over when the time
comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's it for this time. Have a good year 2013 and thank you all for your
support :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

right in action. I'll make a video on how to extend Grid Framework with your
own methods yourself next,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="left" class="youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mb95Nhv8I0" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2012-12-17:grid-framework/news/2012/12/17/hex-intro/</guid><category>old-blog</category><category>how-to</category></item><item><title>How about herring for lunch?</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/11/27/herring-for-lunch/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Another progress update: WorldToGrid and GridToWorld are now implemented. For
those who don't know, those two functions convert a point's coordinates from
world space to grid space, the coordinate system used to locate points relative
to the grid's properties, and back. For rectangular grids it's a fairly simple
idea, the grid can be represented as a standard Cartesian coordinate system.
With hex grids that won't do it, you simply cannot force a hex grid into a
cartesian coordinate system, you need to find something else. Fortunately there
are several topologically identical possibilties whith easier, more intuitive
coordinate systems. For the first release I have decided to use the herringbone
pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/11/27/herring-for-lunch/images/herring.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertices of this pattern are the faces of the hex grid. This means the
central face has coordinates (0, 0, Z) and the face north-east of it has the
coordinates (1, 0, Z). This way each single point of the hex grid can be
canonically identified by its coordinates. "Canonically" means that no two
points have the same coordinates and no two coordinates represent the same
point. As a side effect this gives me an all new grid to work with, although
the herringbone grid will have to wait until later before it gets the proper
treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me almost concludes the hex grid development. The only things left
now are the vertex matrix methods, testing and fixing everything to make sure
it's reliable and then writing the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

For small
objects it's easy, just fit them inside the nearest hex. It gets more
interesting once your object spans over more than one hex. Here is a screenshot
from the game "Age of Wonders" for PC (I upscaled the image manually, AoW has a
very low resolution)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt='Screenshot from "Age of Wonders"' class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/11/22/square-peg-in-round-hole/images/AoW.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the city goes over two hexes and no matter which of the two I
click, I always select the city. I tried many ways of calculating a resonable
way how to fit such an object into a hex grid, but no matter what I tried, it
was bloated, had many cases and, worst of all, didn't really make any sense.
The way Unity is designed is to work with rectangular objects which might be
rotated. In a hex grid system everything is rotated, but only from our point of
view, in terms of game logic everything is the normal way. This is what is
causing problems, I'm trying to force one viewpoint into a different context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's the solution? I decided to go for the easiest and most intuitive
approach: each object will be placed into the centre of its nearest hex. What
about objects that need to go over two fields? In that case the user would have
to set the pivot point manually, either in the 3D modelling aplication or in
Unity by parenting the object to another object and placing them relative to
each other so the pivot object is where you want the pivot point to be. In
fact, this is exactly how the Age of Wonders editor is doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll get a better idea of what I mean when you see it in action. In this
video I'm assembling the structure directly inside the editor. Note that only
the parent spheres have Rigidbodies, but all spheres have colliders and the
script. Unity is designed in such a way that if an object has no rigidbody
calling "rigidbody" will return the RB of its parent. Thus it's always as if I
clicked the parent sphere when I click any sphere of a structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="left" class="youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JxnZxlfhu9g" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a good solution. Unless I somehow come up with a better way to
do aligning this is what I'm going to stick with.&lt;/p&gt;

wanted to remove the entries that met a certain condition. This is what I had
written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
foreach(Transform trns in transformList){
    if(AlreadyAligned(trns))
        transformList.Remove(trns);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gave me the following error message: InvalidOperationException: Collection
was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense, I'm modifying the list I'm currently reading and there is no
way I can be sure I'll catch all entries. There are three ways around this
problem: The first is to use LINQ (C# only), the second is instead of removing
the entries at once to store them in a separate list and then use that list in
a second foreach-loop to remove the entries from the first list and the third
solution is to use a for-loop. After some reseach I reached the conclusion that
the for-loop is the fasted way to achieve the needed results. Here is the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
int counter = transformList.Count;
for(int i = 0; i &amp;lt;= counter - 1; i++){
    if(AlreadyAligned(transformList[i])){
        transformList.RemoveAt(i);
        i --; //reduce the indexer because we removed an entry from list
        counter --; //reduce the counter since the list has become smaller
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all we need to know how many entries the list has initially. I could
have used transformList.Count in the loop directly but this way I don't have to
call the Count method for each iteration. Then we set up the loop, we start at
index 0 and go to counter - 1 (because the index starts at 0 instead of 1). We
perform our check and if it succeeds we remove the entry with index i. Since
the list has now been shortened we need to reduce i because an item that has
been at a position of 7 for example is now at position 6 (assuming that i is
less or equal to 6 in this case). We also need to reduce our counter because
the length of the list has been shortened as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the amount of lines has been doubled, while using LINQ would
have left the code short. If you know that your list will always be small
enough I'd go for the slower but shorter approach. In my case though I have no
idea how large the list will eventually be, so using the for-loop makes perfect
sense. I hope some of you find this useful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

As I mentioned previously
I was busy with exams, so development ws slowed down and during the last couple
of weeks I had to stop completely to concentrate on studies. Now that it's over
I can get back to working on the hex grid update. Currently I'm about halfway
done, maybe more. I'll keep you updated :) Finally, I'd like to thank everyone
who bought Grid Framework so far, you guys have made all this effort worthwhile
and you are the ones who allow me to go on with it. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

introduced text parsing example. Now building new levels is as easy as writing
a few lines of plain text and you get perfect clockwork-like precision. This
opens up new possibilities for faster development, easier maintenance, easier
level editors and support for user-made content. Just take a look at how simle,

to create a breakout-style level based on a grid without changing the scene,
the other is a continuation of my grid-based movement exmple where I can place
obstacles on the grid and the sphere will not step on those squares (without
using any physics like collision and raycasts). Sadly I can't update Grid
Framework because I can't log into my account via Package Manager. My account
still works, I can log into the forums and my Publisher Administration, so the
problem must lie within the editor. I've submitted a bug report, but until then
I cannot publish updates. If you are interested in one of those two examples
please contact me over the Unity forums and I'll send you the examples,
provided that you already own Grid Framework. On a related note, it appears
that Grid Framework's product page in the Asset Store doesn't have any
screenshots. I did submit screenshots, but they don't appear for me, I don't
know if other people can't see them either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawing:&lt;/em&gt; This works perfectly now, the hexes are drawn properly as
described in the post before, and now i have added lines that connect the
different layers of the grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rendering:&lt;/em&gt; Like drawing alsmost finished, except one minor issue. In the
rectangular grids you can specify a width for the rendered line and, since
the line is drawn in 2D, I had to calculate the directions in which to expand
the lines. There were only three possible directions and the lines were
sorted by X, Y and Z, so it was enough to calculate each of the three
directions only once. With hex grids one set of lines is zig-zagged, so I
need to calculate four directions total. I need to find a nice way to
separate the the two differently slanted lines. I don't want to calculate the
direction for every line as that would be a waste of ressources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find nearest face &amp;amp; Get face coordinates:&lt;/em&gt; done, although only for the
default coordinate system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find nearest box &amp;amp; Get box coordinates:&lt;/em&gt; done, just like above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves the following functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find nearest vertex &amp;amp; Get vertex coordinates:&lt;/em&gt; The challenge here lies in
finding a nice coordinate system, and by nice I mean one that's intuitive to
understand, easy to implement and easy to maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build vertex matrix &amp;amp; read vertex matrix:&lt;/em&gt; Getting the vertices is already
done, the challenge again lies in finding a good coordinate system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Align &amp;amp; Scale transform:&lt;/em&gt; shouldn't pose any problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;World to Grid &amp;amp; Grid to World:&lt;/em&gt; you guessed it, deciding on a coodinate
system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Vectrosity Points:&lt;/em&gt; This will take the same points as used by rendering
and drawing, but the array has to be processed first to fit Vectrosity's
requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all in all it looks pretty good. Unfortunately progress has been dragged
down by my studies, I'm writing exams soon, so I can't afford to work on Grid
Framework full time. The plan is to finish all the needed functionalityl for
the first release. After that additional coordinate systems will be added and
after that I'll add more drawing shapes like triangular and circular hex grids.
That will conclude the hex grid chapter of Grid Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

As I mentioned before, there
are many ways to draw hex grids and I want to cover as many of them as
possible. Let's count all the possibilities that work now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three plains to draw on, the XY-, XZ- and YZ-plain. In each case you
have the choice of having pointy sides or flat sides, those are two
possibilities. Every second line is offset upwards, so you can either draw
those offsets or keep the grid compact, so two more choices. Each grid can
begin with an offset colum or not (two more) and end with an offset column or
not (again, two more). That's a total of 3 x 2 x 2 x 4 = 48 possibilities! On
top of that no line should be calculated more than once, or else it would be
drawn twice. That may seem trivial, but if your lines are semi-transparent the
difference between lines drawn once and twice can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I don't want to write and maintain 48 similar algorithms,
everything has to be handled automatically by one single function. Eventually I
got it, it works with any of those possibilities. I've prepared four variations
of the same grid to give you an idea. The upper ones are the pointy sides, the
lower ones are the flat sides. The left ones are fully drawn, the right ones
are compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/08/30/hex-drawing/images/hex-drawing.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other ways to draw a hex grid, as a rhomb, a triangle or a big
hexagon made from smaller hexagons. I will do them after I have the scripting
functionality done, drawing is independent from the other calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

To do
this I will need to swap around variables so I can use the same formulae for
different cases. I could write the swapping part where it is needed, but then
I'd be writing the same thing several times (which is a bad thing to do).
Wouldn't it be better if there was some sort of swapping function? Could that
function work for any type of variable? Could it work without needing to
reassign variables again? Yes to all of that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Swap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works the usual way, you create a temporary variable, assign one variable to
it, then assign the second to the first and the temporary to the second. The T
stands for the type, this is a generic function, meaning you can use it for any
type you want. You can swap int, float or even something crazy like Collider or
something usermade. The ref means that the changes done to the variables in the
function are reflected right back. Usually a function "copies" the values
passed and leaves the original variables untouched. To use the code you would
write something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code csharp literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Swap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some tricks floating around on the internet without the use of a
temporary variable and using math tricks instead, don't use those. At best your
code just gets ugly, at worst you even get worse performance. Also, you are
limiting yourself to numbers only, whereas this Swap function works for
anything. Hooray for generics!&lt;/p&gt;

going on. As I finished rendering I had tightened up all loose ends that were
left, I consider Grid Framework to be complete for rectangular grids. You can
perform all the common calculations, debug things and visualize the grid
properly, either using simple lines or even Vectrosity. This is just the first
step though. Hex grids are very popular for games for various reasons, so it
makes perfect sense to do them next, right? Well, here is where the problem
starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, while making Grid Framework there are several challenges I need to face
(let's just ignore things like documentation or presentation for now).
Obviously I need to code the whole thing. I also need to figure out the math
for how to even do these calculations. None of those are really any big
secrets, the math has been there for centuries and the coding part is just
turning verbose instructions into C# code. It's a pretty straight-forward
process, more or less, once you figured out what to do and how to do it. And
that's where the current challenge lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rectangular grids are relatively simple. Being in 3D and able to rotate and
translate and having individual spacing made them more complicated, but it was
still the same basic formulae, just more expanded. Hex grids are not as easy,
simply because there is more you can do with them. This leaves me with some
really nasty design decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing an extension I need to keep in mind that it will be used by lots
of different people who might have different ideas about what a hex grid should
work like. Some might want to fit a grid inside a rectangle, like in battle for
Wesnoth, others might want one big hexagon made of smaller hexagons, like in
Settlers of Catan. I cannot just pick one and tell the others to convert their
game to the other type. This also raises the question of coordinates. A
rectangular grid is just a standard cartesian coordinate system with some
stretching and squeezing. I can even have fractions of a coordinate to give a
precise position. If I fit a hex grid inside a rectangular grid, can I still
have fractions? Do I even want such a feature? What should the coordinates
represent, vertices or faces? What about the pointy side of a hexagon, is it
one unit or just half a unit? Speaking of which, how does everything change if
I want the tops to be pointy instead of the sides? Where should the origin lie?
How many axes should even be there? (don't laugh, once concept uses four
dimensions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these questions can be answered, that is not the problem. The problem
lies in answering them all in a way that is clean to implement, clean to
maintain and clean for the end user to use. Should I make different hex grid
classes, which would be easier to code, but would mean more code to maintain
and more API for the user? I would like to just start coding and see what
happens, but these questions need to be answered first, or the code will
explode right in my face. I don't know how long it will take, but I'm working
on it.&lt;/p&gt;

with Vectrosity from just one line of code. I played a bit with Vectrosity to
make an example scene and this is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of laser-line grids" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/08/12/vectrosity-progress/images/vectorsity-progress.png"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;(yes, I am a sucker for laser lines)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green grid just hangs there and rotates, the red grid bounces around (using
Unity's physics engine), the yellow grid resizes itself all the time and the
colourful grid changes the colours of its lines randomly. The "missing" lines
in the last grid lines are not a bug, they are sill there but coloured black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect version 1.1.2 to be the last feature update before adding Hex Grids,
so I want to wrap up all the loose ends I might still have left. In particular
I want to integrate the components into Unity's main interface, no more
dragging scripts onto GameObjects.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2012-08-12:grid-framework/news/2012/08/12/vectrosity-progress/</guid><category>old-blog</category><category>example</category><category>extension</category></item><item><title>Line width for rendering</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/08/09/line-width-for-rendering/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I just submitted version 1.1.1 (&lt;em&gt;update: has been approved&lt;/em&gt;) which lets you set
the width of the rendered line in the inspector. Here is an example, obviously
it's over the top, but you can set the width to anything you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/08/09/line-width-for-rendering/images/line-width.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to provide a nice function to pass rendering points to
Vectrosity. I'm sure those of you who own a Vectrosity license would like to be
able to combine the best of both. I promise when I'm done it will be the last
time you'll see me talk about rendering for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2012-08-09:grid-framework/news/2012/08/09/line-width-for-rendering/</guid><category>old-blog</category></item><item><title>A new inspector</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/08/07/new-inspector/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I wanted to do this sooner or later anyway, so I made a custom editor for
the rectangluar grid. Before this I was using the default inspector panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/08/07/new-inspector/images/inspector.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why am I doing GUI stuff if I'm supposed to work on the rendering? Well, as
I said I need to clean up the code, which involves looping through two custom
classes of mine, ColorVector3 and BoolVector3. If you used Vector3 you know you
can access values using something like myVector.x, but you can also use an
index instead: myVector[0]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to have both in my two classes so I could loop through them in one go
rather than write a special case for each entry and provide an intuitive syntax
for users. The solution was using an indexer, setters and getters. They all
work fine in code, but I cannot get getters and setter to display in the
inspector and manipulating the entries directly could break things. The
solution was writing my own inspector from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from now being able to provide a safe and clean way to set colors and
toggle axes the new inspector looks cleaner and the attributes are sorted in a
way that makes more sense, rather than the way the class is built. I'm still
not satisfied with some parts, the axis colours don't have labels and the the
hide axis flags should be on the same line, like the Vector3 field. However, if
I force them on one line or add labels to the coulour flieds the space for the
labels is so large that the controls start overlapping, so it looks even worse
than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it does look better now and gives me the code improvements I need for
clean rendering, so all in all it's a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/08/06/grid-rendering-progress/images/grid-rendering-progress.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's so special? Look at the upper right corner, gizmos are turned off. This
is a grid rendered at runtime that would be visible in a released game. There
are still some things to care take of first: For one, the grid needs to get
rendered every frame, which is not a big deal when using the GL class, but a
Vectrosity-like approach where a mesh is built only once and then drawn once
until it updates would be pretty neat. Also, the GL class doesn't let you set
the width of lines, I could draw quads instead, but those are only thick if you
look directly at them, otherwise they get thinner until they become invisble
(in other words, they are flat). Lines are always the same, no matter the angle
or distance, which could be exactly what you want or not. Maybe I could include
some way for users to use Vectrosity easily if they have a license? In any
case, I need to finish this first. The code is still very messy, being in large
parts copy-pasted from the drawing code (which was kind of messy itself) and
copy-pasting code is a sure way to have your project explode right in your
face. I'll need to write a method to return a nice list of points that both
drawing and rendering can use.&lt;/p&gt;

game. This is the tutorial for the lights-out game I mentioned before and which
has been included with the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="left" class="youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXlagrglfQ8" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is written in C# because it uses delegates and events. The reason
why is so that no single tile needs to know about the other tiles, making this
code extremely flexible, you culd even change your scene during runtime. If you
don't know about delegates and events I really recommend you to check out
prime31studios' video. Their video series really got me into C# development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="left" class="youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2zdwKIsXJs" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you the basic idea, events and delegates mean that somewhere somehow
something happens and some other objects react to that. The object that
triggered the event itself has no idea who (if anyone) is listening and how
they will resond. For example you could have an RPG where when you draw your
sword it makes villagers run away and guards draw their own weapons. Your hero
would not need to know how many villagers and guards (if any) are around, he
just needs to fire the event and all listeners will react accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

There are three examples included, one
showcasing grid-based movement, one showcasing how to place objects on a grid
during gameplay and the lights-out game mentioned below. i also made tutorial
videos for the first two, showcasing how you can accomplish these tasks in a
simple manner on your own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="left" class="youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9_efVi_tFs" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left" class="youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QqUzcthkvcc" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2012-07-29:grid-framework/news/2012/07/29/grid-movement-and-runtime-snapping/</guid><category>old-blog</category><category>example</category></item><item><title>A quick update</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/07/27/a-quick-update/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have been contacted by an Asset Store admin, who recommends me to include a
demo scene so users could see an end setup. I thought dragging a script onto an
object is pretty straight-forward, but I agree, a demo scene would be a really
good idea. The tricky party is coming up with good ideas; don't get me wrong, I
have plenty of ideas for actual gameplay examples, but for a demo scene I need
something more basic and at the same time more catchy. I already made a little
sphere that randomly roams a grid face by face, stays within limits and
immediately adapts to changes in the grid, all with just 32 lines of code total
(not counting whitespaces and comments). I'll come up with two or three more
nice demos, that should give a good impression of Grid Framework  in action.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2012-07-27:grid-framework/news/2012/07/27/a-quick-update/</guid><category>old-blog</category></item><item><title>Almost there...</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/07/22/almost-there/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it's alsmost done. Again. Turns out that making an asset is only half the
job, you still need to hammer out any ugly dents, polish the thing and then
change your job to become a graphic designer, a video commentator, a writer and
a salesman! What good is the best asset if you present it in such a way that
makes people not even want to take a look? I'm not claiming that I'm an expert
in any of those fields, but I believe I did a pretty good job (well, maybe my
voice work for the video could use some improvements). In a way I'm glad the
old "images" I had prepared for the first version are now lost forever, that
was something to turn people away forever. You cannot imagine how awful those
looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I finished the videos, I made the drawings for the asset store and I
wrote the documentation. The only things left now are uploading the videos
(which will take quite a while with my connection), writing a description text
for the asset store (shouldn't be too much, so it won't take too long) and then
sending the files over to Unity. In the meantime, please enjoy a small teaser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="an image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/07/22/almost-there/images/Grid_image_big.png"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Unfortunately clicking this won't do anything. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2012-07-22:grid-framework/news/2012/07/22/almost-there/</guid><category>old-blog</category></item><item><title>Turn off the lights!</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/05/29/turn-off-the-lights/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a nice little puzzle game made using the grid framework. When you click
a square that square and the four adjacent squares flip their color. Your task
is to turn them all off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot from lights out game example" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/05/29/turn-off-the-lights/images/lights-out.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire game uses only two scripts with a total of 70 lines of code. Sure,
that may not seem like a small amount, but keep in mind that almost half of
that is just whitespace and comments for better readability. The other half is
mostly just to handle the user's input and only two lines are used for
grid-based operations, i. e. finding out which tiles to flip. What's even
better is that this works for any setup, you can even have holes and weird
apendages like in the above picture. You could even move tiles during gameplay
or generate the puzzle dynamically rather than by hand every time. Grid
framework always finds the right tiles for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will put up a video tutorial eventually once the package is released. I used
delegates and events, so if you don't know what they are take a look at
prime31studios' video tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="left" class="youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2zdwKIsXJs" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2012 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2012-05-29:grid-framework/news/2012/05/29/turn-off-the-lights/</guid><category>old-blog</category><category>example</category></item><item><title>State of the game</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/05/14/state-of-the-game/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It has been over a month since I posted the introductory video and sent my
application to Unity. I never received any confirmation, so I assume it got
lost somewhere along the way...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that doesn't mean I have been sitting here for over a month staring at
the screen and refreshing my mail. I started working on this project because I
needed a simple solution for one certain problem, that's how I started working
and over time more and more ideas came to my mind. It was clear that I would
need a complete rewrite sooner or later, so I decided to release a simple
version first and then start the rewrite instead of throwing everything up to
that point out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sent my submission to Unity I was done with the old concept and started
working on the new, more robust concept that would allow for far more features
to be implemented cleanly. This meant switching to C# (since some things just
aren't possible in UnityScript) and diving deeper into the documentation than
ever before. I like the results. I set myself a few goals and so far I have
achieved most of them. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grids as components instead of plain classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully support 3D grids and rotation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functions to find vertices, faces and boxes with just one line of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a nice panel for aligning and scaling instead of that dirty workaround&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch between grid coordinates and world coordinates (and vice-versa) with just one line of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every kind of grid (quare grid, hex grid, triangular grid) inherits from one common Grid class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most work has been done under the hood to keep the code clean. It's easy to
insert a new feature into clean code where I can leverage already existing
methods instead of having to write the same thing several times (copy-pasting
chunks of code is an awful idea!).  The one thing that still needs a good look
are the methods related to the vertex matrix, it's one of those things that are
easy to break if you aren't careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, once it's done the (hopefully now) first release would be ready to
ship. I'd also have to rewrite the entire documentation and draw new logos for
the Asset Store (in a way I'm glad my first submission got lost, those
"drawings" were just aweful)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fist release would only cover rectangular grids with hex grids added next,
then finally triangular grids. I haven't started implementing them, but I have
already done the math and I know how to do it, I just need to finish this
first. The one last thing I can think of is grid pathfinding, but I won't even
waste a thought on that until I get the other stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[video deleted]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic overview of what the first release has to offer. Stay tuned for future updates. The package is waiting for approval now.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HiPhish</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:hiphish.github.io,2012-04-11:grid-framework/news/2012/04/11/introduction-video/</guid><category>old-blog</category></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/04/09/introduction/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working on making a 2D platformer in Unity in the spirit of the old
8 Bit and 16 Bit games such as Super Mario and Sonic. One thing I really admire
about those games is their sense of clockwork-like precision, you never feel
cheated by the controls, you always know which jumps you can make and which
ones you can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this precision comes from how these games can easily be broken up into
blocks. For example Mario is either 1x1 blocks or 1x2 blocks large (actually
it's slightly less, but let's not get lost in details here), he can jump a
certain height and certain distance at a certain given speed and the level
designers can easily calculate how many blocks they need to use to make the
game just challenging enough to be fun but not unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, I would have to do the same thing. I would need to come up with a
certain block size (let's say 1x1 in Unity units) and adjust the scale and
position of everything accordingly by hand. Not fun at all. Wouldn't it be
awesome if Unity had some sort of grid framework, some way of specifying the
grid's spacing and origin and just have the computer do the rest? Couldn't the
computer scale and position my blocks inside the grid instead of me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you need it, then make it, that's what I told myself. After coming up
with an approach and a long-term plan of what to do I made the first step, a 2D
grid class that can be used for scaling and alignment. The script will match
you objects as closely to the grid as possible, so if your block is slightly
larger it will shrink and if it's slightly smaller it will grow. With just a
single key combo you can turn this messy Breakout field&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into this clean arrangement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/04/09/introduction/images/Breakout.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it took me longer to put those blocks into the scene than to align
and scale them. As you can see some blocks didn't even have the right
proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="some image" class="img-responsive" src="http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/04/09/introduction/images/Breakout2.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course aligning and scaling is not all this is good for. As I mentioned
before, the 2D grid is a class and as such can be used for scripting as well.
The functions for scaling and aligning are built into the class so you can
perform these actions during runtime. You could use the grid for path finding
or anything you want. Every grid contains a matrix of its vertices, allowing
you to instantly read any point within a specified range just by providing the
coordinates, no math needed. Every grid is infinite in size since it's only
defined by origin and spacing (the vertex matrix obviously isn't infinite) so
there are no limitis to how far you can go with this grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently doing some polishing and fixing minor bugs. A promotional YouTube
video will be coming soon, I finished writing the script, now I need to record
it. Once I'm done the assets (including the documentation with scripting
reference) will be avaible in the Unity Asset Store for an affordable price.
The future plans are to properly support 3D grids with rotation, make the
interface more convenient, have mouse snapping in the editor, hex grids and
whatever else I can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
