Grid Framework now has its own homepage:

[http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/](http://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/)

I have been running this blog now for almost three years, which is way too long
to go without a proper website. Back when I had just started out I didn't know
if Grid Framework would ever take off, so I organised everything in a quick &
simple manner, but I think it's finally time to step up my presentation.

The site is hosted on GitHub, so you can browse the source code if you wish,
it's all handwritten in HTML and CSS, nothing fancy. There are still a few
things I would like to overhaul, like a proper screenshot gallery, playable
examples and redo the videos. But for now the site is at least presentable.

If you have any suggestions or find display errors on some devices please let
me know.
