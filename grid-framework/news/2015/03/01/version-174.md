title: Grid Framework version 1.7.4 released

Grid Framework version 1.7.4 has been approved by the Asset Store team. This
release brings official support for Unity 5, so feel free to upgrade. Unity 4
is still supported, thanks to the changes to the Asset Store I can now upload
separate packages for different versions of Unity.

There are no API changes, so it doesn't matter whether you want to use Unity 4
or 5. The only real difference between packages are the example scenes. The
formats Unity 5 uses are different from 4, so a package created in Unity 5
would appear broken in 4.
