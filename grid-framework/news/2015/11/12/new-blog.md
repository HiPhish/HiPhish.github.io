**Update:** Feeds are live now, see the navigator. You can even subscribe to
just a category such as *release* for instance by navigating to that category
and using the links in the top right-hand corner.

Welcome to the new blog for Grid Framework on the new website. I have migrated
all the old blog posts here as well (with all typos and everything). The old
blog is still available for the time being, but I won't post anything there
anymore.

This website has support for multiple blogs, so this blog will from now on be
used for news only. Once I have feeds working you will also be able to
subscribe to get the latests news delivered right to you.

That's if for now, this was the last step needed in the migration to the new
website.
