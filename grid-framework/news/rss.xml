major release, it is not backwards compatible with version 2.x. Upgrading from
version 2.x or 1.x is free for existing customers. Here are the highlights of

for the major version 3 release because it solves a number of problems I had
with the previous releases. Unfortunately I have to dial back somewhat because
the Asset Store only accepts contents stored inside the Assets directory of a

doesn't have to be the most shameful thing, just something that you really are
not proud of should do. Now imagine putting it in a sealed box where it will be

lifting the lid as the rancid smell starts creeping out of the box. That is how
it felt when I opened up the old Playmaker support.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/09/14/playmaker-actions-overhaul/</guid><pubdate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>progress</category></item><item><title>Git packages or embedded packages?

be made available as a public Git repository under the MIT license, that should

transitioning to packages has had many advantages there have also been some
challenges to overcome and I would like to go over them in this post.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/07/31/vectrosity-support-as-package/</guid><pubdate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>progress</category></item><item><title>Embracing the Unity package system</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/07/11/embracing-the-unity-packages-system/</link><description>When I released version 1 and version 2 of Grid Framework there was no real way
of separating libraries. You had to dump everything into your project in one
assembly. Using namespaces prevented name collisions, but you still had things
like examples or documentation bloating up your project and there was no way of
expressing dependencies. Since then Unity has introduced its own package system,
which will solve many of the problems I have had in the past.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/07/11/embracing-the-unity-packages-system/</guid><pubdate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>progress</category></item><item><title>Vectrosity rendering backend</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/06/29/vectrosity-rendering-backend/</link><description>I have finished the rendering backend for Vectrosity and updated the included
examples to use it. Previous releases already came with an extension method
that let you get the list of points to construct a vector line, but the actual
construction of the vector line was up to the user.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/06/29/vectrosity-rendering-backend/</guid><pubdate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>progress</category></item><item><title>Mesh-based rendering</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/05/09/mesh-based-rendering/</link><description>The big one has landed: mesh-based rendering. This is the main reason for the
major version bump and it is fully working now. Mesh-based rendering means that
instead of drawing lines using the low-level GL class a mesh is generated
which Unity can then render the same way it renders any other mesh. This means
that grid lines can now be rendered below sprites instead of always on top of
them.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/05/09/mesh-based-rendering/</guid><pubdate>Sun, 09 May 2021 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>progress</category></item><item><title>Version 3 reaching feature parity with version 2</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/04/25/version-3-feature-parity-with-version-2/</link><description>Grid Framework version 3.0 is coming along nicely, I have reached feature

the grid rendering system. It has been almost five years since the release of

Grid Framework.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2021/01/08/plans-for-grid-framework-3.0/</guid><pubdate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 01:00:00 +0100</pubdate><category>progress</category></item><item><title>Grid Framework version 2.1.8 released</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2019/05/20/release-2.1.8/</link><description>Grid Framework version 2.1.8 has been approved by the Asset Store.

      Being a major version update this breaks compatibility  with the version
      1.x releases,  but an upgrade guide is included in  the user manual.  If
      you  still cannot  upgrade to  2.0 you can still keep using 1.x, but the

re-adjusting screenshots I think we are good to go.  I still have to figure out
how to set up the Upgrade option in the Asset Store, but it can't be that hard.

This
version brings a great new feature for anyone interested in making isometric 2D
games: shearing. Shearing allows you to slant a rectangular grid's axes without
having to rotate the grid. Up until now the only way to achieve the isometric
look was to rotate the grid or the camera in 3D space, but in 2D games the
camera has to be perpendicular to the image plane and thus the grid as well.
Now all you need to do is just set the shearing of the axes and you're good to
go, everything else stays the way it was.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2014/09/16/version-150/</guid><pubdate>Tue, 16 Sep 2014 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>release</category></item><item><title>Whitelisting subdirectories in Git</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2014/09/09/whitelisting-in-git/</link><description>After having migrated the development of Grid Framework to Git I wanted to set

It also adds a chapter to the manual about extending Grid Framework with your
own code. There is nothing in there experienced .NET user wouldn't know, but I
figure some user might not know about extension methods and might do things in
a hacky way, so I added the chapter to it, along with example code.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/09/20/version-134/</guid><pubdate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>release</category></item><item><title>Grid Framework version 1.3.3 released</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/08/28/version-133/</link><description>Grid Framework version 1.3.3 has been approved by the Asset Store team. This
update addresses a bug introduced in version 1.3.2 where values of colour
vectors (such as axisColor) and bool vectors were not persistent. Now they will
stick again. I also broke the examples for the sliding puzzle and movement with
obstacles, which are now fixed. Based upon a customer's question I also built a
snake game example; it's mostly an extension of the grid-based movement but
with several snake segments following each other.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/08/28/version-133/</guid><pubdate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>release</category></item><item><title>Grid Framework version 1.3.2 released</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/08/09/version-132/</link><description>Version 1.3.2 of Grid Framework has been approved by the Asset Store Team. The
biggest news is the  addition of new coordinate systems for hexagonal grids.
You have cubic coordinates, rhombic coordinates and the old odd herringbone
coordinates now. Even herringbone and barycentric coordinates will be added at
some point in the future for the sake of completion, but they are no priority.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/08/09/version-132/</guid><pubdate>Fri, 09 Aug 2013 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>release</category></item><item><title>Status update and Doxygen rant</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/08/02/status-update/</link><description>It has been two weeks since my last update, so I wanted to let you guys know
what I am currently at. The good news is that the new coordinate systems have
been implemented and are ready to use. Of course there is still the obligatory
last check to do, but i expect everything to be fine. All methods that got the
axe are now gone as well and have been put into extension methods and ZIPped
into archives; that way no one will accidentally use the deprecated API. I also
added a section called Legacy Support to the manual with instructions.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/08/02/status-update/</guid><pubdate>Fri, 02 Aug 2013 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>misc</category></item><item><title>What's up next?</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/07/19/whats-up-next/</link><description>Hello everyone, I decided to do a status update so you know what's going on and

rendering always went like this: Manager requests rendering from grid -&gt; grid
calculates the end points of each line -&gt; these points get passed to Unity's GL
class for rendering. Every single frame. I have introduced a caching feature
that will store all the calculated points and reuse them instead of calculating
everything all over again as long as the grid has not been modified.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/03/30/endless-grid/</guid><pubdate>Sat, 30 Mar 2013 01:00:00 +0100</pubdate><category>tips</category></item><item><title>Grid Framework version 1.2.3 released</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/02/28/version-123/</link><description>This update brings you two new features, both were suggested by customers. The
first one is the ability to set a separate set of colours for rendering instead
of using the same colours as for drawing. Let's say you want a barely visible
grid in the game but a clearly visible grid in the editor. Until now you either
had had to have two grids or use a script to change the colours once the game
starts. Both options worked fine but required more work than needed, now you
can do it out of the box. Of course it is entirely optional, so if you don't
set anything you will be using the same colours for rendering and drawing.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/02/28/version-123/</guid><pubdate>Thu, 28 Feb 2013 01:00:00 +0100</pubdate><category>release</category></item><item><title>Unity and properties/accessors</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2013/02/14/properties-accessors/</link><description>As mentioned in the previous post I'd like to relate my experience with using

want to reuse it. Wouldn't it be great if it was a class method in Grid
Framework so you could simply call it with one line of code? Even better, what
if you could have one method that has the same syntax for both rectangular and
hexagonal grids but different implementation based on the type of grid, so you
would have to write just one script for any type of grid? Luckily this is no
problem in Unity thanks to extension methods and if you have the code, then
wrapping it up into an extension method can de done in a few minutes. Take a
look at my latest video tutorial:</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/12/24/how-to-extend/</guid><pubdate>Mon, 24 Dec 2012 01:00:00 +0100</pubdate><category>tips</category></item><item><title>Hex Grid introduction video</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/12/17/hex-intro/</link><description>I made a short video giving you an overview of hex grids, so you can see them

grids. I'll soon make a video demonstrating the new grid, in the meantime let
me explain it in words. My implementation brings you all the features you knew
from rectangular grids, except on a hex grid, and both grids inherit from the
same base class. This means the API for both is the same and you can write one
script for both grids with little to no need to make special adjustments for
different grid classes. Currently there is only one coordinate system and hex
grids have &quot;only&quot; as much functionality as rectangular grids. I wish to improve
upon this in the future.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/12/07/version-120/</guid><pubdate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 01:00:00 +0100</pubdate><category>release</category></item><item><title>Grid Framework version 1.2.0 submitted</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/12/07/version-120-submitted/</link><description>Just a quick update, version 1.2.0 has been submitted.

which takes in a vector and then scales it so it fits inside the grid. This is
similar to AlignVector3, which was introduced in the last update, to allow
performing the aligning and scaling without having to provide an actual
Transform.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/11/30/version-1110/</guid><pubdate>Fri, 30 Nov 2012 01:00:00 +0100</pubdate><category>release</category></item><item><title>How about herring for lunch?</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/11/27/herring-for-lunch/</link><description>Another progress update: WorldToGrid and GridToWorld are now implemented.
For those who don't know, those two functions convert a point's coordinates
from world space to grid space, the coordinate system used to locate points
relative to the grid's properties, and back. For rectangular grids it's a
fairly simple idea, the grid can be represented as a standard Cartesian
coordinate system.  With hex grids that won't do it, you simply cannot force a
hex grid into a Cartesian coordinate system, you need to find something else.
Fortunately there are several topologically identical possibilities with
easier, more intuitive coordinate systems. For the first release I have decided
to use the herringbone pattern:</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/11/27/herring-for-lunch/</guid><pubdate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 01:00:00 +0100</pubdate><category>progress</category></item><item><title>Trying to fit a square peg into a hex hole</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/11/22/square-peg-in-round-hole/</link><description>The align feature has been giving me quite some headache lately.

objects it's easy, just fit them inside the nearest hex. It gets more

to create a breakout-style level based on a grid without changing the scene,
the other is a continuation of my grid-based movement example where I can place
obstacles on the grid and the sphere will not step on those squares (without
using any physics like collision and raycasts). Sadly I can't update Grid
Framework because I can't log into my account via Package Manager. My account
still works, I can log into the forums and my Publisher Administration, so the
problem must lie within the editor. I've submitted a bug report, but until then
I cannot publish updates. If you are interested in one of those two examples
please contact me over the Unity forums and I'll send you the examples,
provided that you already own Grid Framework. On a related note, it appears
that Grid Framework's product page in the Asset Store doesn't have any

rendering. If you are wondering why this wasn't the case before, it was a
leftover from before the custom rendering range got implemented. Originally the
custom range was only meant for rendering because that would be what the layer
sees in the final game, not the drawing, whether they are the same or not.
Also, the drawing is only a drawing, the grid keeps working beyond what's
visible, being infinite. That's why the drawing had low priority and I worked
on other parts instead.</description><guid ispermalink="true">https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/09/06/version-115/</guid><pubdate>Thu, 06 Sep 2012 02:00:00 +0200</pubdate><category>release</category></item><item><title>Version 1.1.4 released</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/grid-framework/news/2012/09/05/version-114/</link><description>Version 1.1.4 has been approved.

this I will need to swap around variables so I can use the same formulae for

I'd be writing the same thing several times (which is a bad thing to do).
Wouldn't it be better if there was some sort of swapping function? Could that
function work for any type of variable? Could it work without needing to
reassign variables again?
