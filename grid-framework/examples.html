		To help you get started Grid Framework comes with several examples showing you
		how to implement from scratch features commonly found in games, such as moving
		along a grid, using the grid for game logic like in a puzzle game, assembling
		a level and even extending Grid Framework with your own methods without
		touching the source code of Grid Framwork itself.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		All the examples are written both in C# and Java Script, when technically
		possible, and the source code has comments explaining the idea behind almost
		every line of code. I also have tutorial videos where I build those examples
		from scratch and expain the idea behind the code, for those of you who prefer
		learning by doing rather than having the source code served to them in one go.
	</p>

	<p>
		These videos were recorded at different points in Grid Framworks development and
		the interface and usability may appear more crude than it currently is.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Moving along a grid</h1>
	<iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/m9_efVi_tFs" />
	<p>
		One of the most common uses for grids is movement. Maybe you have a tactical
		game, or a board game or you just want the old-school feel of tile based games.
		In this example we convert a sphere's world coordinates to grid coordinates and
		then move it in grid space before converting the result back to world space. As
		an extra touch we can limit the sphere to only stay within the bounds of the
		grid size. We need this because grids are infinitely large, so the sphere could
		wander off into infinity.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Moving with obstacles</h1>
	<iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/m9_efVi_tFs" />
	<p>
		Moving around freely is nice, but let's make it more interesting by introducing
		obstacles. We could just use Unity's physics along with raycasting to see if our
		target location is free, but where would be the fun in that? Instead in this
		example we learn how to build a matrix where each entry corresponds to a tile
		in the grid. For the sake of simplicity we only store a bolean value, whether
		the tile is free or occupied, in the matrix, but we could easily extend the
		format to store more information, such as the terrain, the type of obstacle
		(wall, enemy, door, item) or even a reference to the object blockign our path.
	</p>
	
	<h1>lights-out puzzle game</h1>
	<iframe title="YouTube" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sXlagrglfQ8" />
	<p>
		Here we learn how write a simple puzzle game where the goal is to turn all the
		lights off and every time you click a square that square and the four adjacent
		ones flip their colour. No tile knows anythign about its surrounding tiles,
		making this game very flexible, you can have all sorts of crazy shapes and
		holes in it. This example uses delegates and events and is therefore only
		available in C#.
	</p>
	
	<h1>extending Grid Framework with your own methods</h1>
	<iframe title="YouTube" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/W_QteDtqHK4" />
	<p>
		This is a continuation of the above example where we extend the game to use a
		hexagonal grid. Needless to say we don't want to write almost the same script
		twice, so instead we will learn how to write our own method for the GFGrid
		class that picks its implementation depending on the specific type of grid we
		use. Then we can use the same script for both rectangular and hexagonal grids.
	</p>
	
	<h1>assembling a level from text file</h1>
	<iframe title="YouTube" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lvYWbJ8ohkA" />
	<p>
		In this example we create a breakout field by parsing a plain text file placing
		objects on the grid accoirding to the position inside the file. This appoach
		has several advantages; most obviously it is faster and easier to design level
		in plain text rather than in an editor, you can add new levels very easily or
		allow players to add their own levels and you can reverse the process to write
		a text file from an ingame level editor. Instead of having a separate scene for
		each level we only need one scene, we can build new levels without having to
		worry about carrying the background or music from scene to scene, allowing for
		seamless transition.
	</p>

	<h1>runtime snapping</h1>
	<iframe title="YouTube" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QqUzcthkvcc" />
	<p style="height:209px;">
		If you want to allow the user to place object only on the grid, then this
		example is for you. For an extra challenge the grid has been rotated to create
		an isometric view effect. In reality you should rotat the camera instead.
