	<h1>calculations</h1>
	
	<p>
		Grid Framework can convert from world coordiantes to grid coordinates and vice-
		versa with just one line of code. You can let it find the nearest vertex, face
		or box, scale objects or snap them in place without needing to write any formulae,
		it's all wrapped up for you. This allows you to write your game logic thinking
		entirely in grid coordinates while the game plays out in world coordinates. Then
		just let Grid Framework convert the result back into world space and you're ready to go.
	</p>
	
	<h1>infinite size and fully 3D</h1>
	
	<p>
		The size of a grid is irrelevant, what really defines a grid is its origin, its
		type and a few parameters. Using this information we can perform any calculation
		at any point, no matter how far from the origin we are. In fact, the distance doesn't
		even impact our performance, all calculations always run at the same speed. Of course
		Grid Framework's infinity is limited to what Unity is capable of and there is no true
		infinity on computers, but Grid Framwork can get as close to it as possible in Unity.
		Best of all, grids are in 3D and move and rotate with the object they are attached to;
		if you need a grid's rotation or position just get the information from the Transform
		component, like any other object in Unity.
	</p>

	<h1>Extremely lightweight</h1>
	
	<p>
		Grid Framework was designed to keep it simple, to just be there when you need it but
		never intrude with the workflow. All calculation methods run in constant time and the
		classes just store a handful of float values, keeping the performance impact to a minimum.
		No matter whether you are targeting desktop devices or mobile phones and tablets, Grid
		Framework will work with a minimum of resources.
	</p>

	<h1>rendering &amp; drawing</h1>
	
	<p>
		You can both draw your grids in the editor using gizmos and render them at runtime. You
		can turn individual axes on or off, set the colour for each axis individually, change the
		width of the lines and even use your own shaders if the default shader doesn't suit your
		needs. Redering is done using Unity's low-level rendering capabilities, so it is blazing
		fast even on mobile devices. Keep in mind though, that while the rendering is cheap,
		getting points for large and very dense grids might not be. If your grids are exceptionally
		large you will be glad to know that Grid Framework fully supports Vectrosity.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Vectrosity support</h1>
	
	<p>
		Vectrosity is a popular 3rd party vector line drawing solution for Unity. Instead of
		rendering lines point by point, Vectrosity can construct a mesh and then render the mesh
		in one go, making it an ideal solution for complex figure with many points, such as very
		dense grids. While using Vectrosity on its own would require you to calculate all end
		points yourself and then order them in the proper way so they appear in the right order,
		Grid Framework can do the job for you by just calling the built in method. For more
		information on Vectrosity please visit <a href="http://starscenesoftware.com/vectrosity.html">
		Vectrosity's web site</a>. Please note that Vectrosity and Grid Framework are entirely
		unrelated products and I am in no way affiliated with the author of Vectrosity.
	</p>
	
	<h1>fits seamlessly into Unity</h1>
	
	<p>
		There is no new interface to learn or new editor panel to add to the project (unless you
		want to use the align panel of course), instead it fits nicely into Unity as if it had always
		been a part of it. The grid classes have their own custom inspector and you can create grids
		from scratch, add a grid component to any of your Game Objects or browse the documentation
		right from you menu bar, just like any other component in Unity.
	</p>
	
	<h1>full documentation</h1>
	
	<p>
		Just like Unity itself, Grid Frameworks comes with a user manual that explains you the ideas
		and concepts of Grid Framework, the coordinate sytems used and the design principles. The
		scripting reference has all classes with their member variables and methods covered. Hyperlinks
		to entries in the documentation as well as links to Unity's own scriptiong reference let you
		find anything conventiently.
	</p>
	
	<h1>free updates</h1>
	
	<p>
		As Grid Framework improves update will be released adding new features. Once you buy a copy of
		Grid Framework you will be entitled to all future updates for free, even if the price goes up.
		This is my way way of thanking everyone who supports me in the early stages :)
