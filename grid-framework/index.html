				Grid Framework is a powerful, yet easy to use solution for all your
				grid based needs. By providing you with new classes all you need to do
				is apply the grid component of your choice onto a Game Object, set the
				values to your liking and start writing your game logic without
				worrying about the underlying math. No matter whether you are making a
				board game, a strategy game, a puzzle game, an arcade-style game or
				just any other type of game that needs clockwork-like precision, Grid
				Framework will help you in setting up your game and writing your game
				logic in an intuitive way.
			</p>
		
			<h1>What exactly is Grid Framework?</h1>
		
			<p>
				The simplest way to describe Grid Framework would be to call it
				a <em>library</em>.  It provides you with new classes and new
				components complete with custom inspectors, ready to use. It
				also serves as an editor extension by providing you with an
				align panel, allowing you to auto-snap objects right in the
				editor.  You can set the properties of the new grid components
				in the editor and use them in scripting, just like any other
				component of Unity.
			</p>
		
			<h1>Why Grid Framework?</h1>
		
			<p>
				Grid Framework was carefully designed with flexibility in mind.
				No two games are the same, and even if they might appear
				similar on the outside, their inner workings could be very
				different. I wanted to write a solutions that doesn't lock you
				into a specific workflow, instead it gives you the parts needed
				and you put them in place the way that suits your game best.
				All Grid Framework does is wrap up the mathematical formulae
				into simple methods to call, allowing you to focus on the
				actual game instead.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is important to understand that Grid Framework is not a kit
				that takes away all the coding, you still need to code your
				game logic. However, unlike a kit that locks you into a
				specific workflow and only allows you to do what its developer
				intended, Grid Framework has no limited use and seamlessly fits
				into your own workflow.  No matter if you want to rewrite your
				existing logic or start from scratch, you are ready to go.
			</p>
			<p>
				To help you out there are several <a href="examples">examples</a>
				included to demonstrate how to perform common tasks, such as moving
				the player on a grid, snapping objects during runtime or assembling
				levels from plain text files. All examples are written in C# and
				JavaScript, when possible, and the code is commented thoroughly.
			</p>
