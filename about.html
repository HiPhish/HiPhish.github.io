		Thank you for your interest in my work. Currently the only product on this
		site is Grid Framework, the editor and scripting extension for the Unity3D
		game engine that adds grids, but I want to increase my range of products in
		the future. To learn more about Grid Framework please visit its entry on this
		site.

		If you are looking for support, have questions or just want to share your
		opinion the best way is to visit the
		<a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/144886-Grid-Framework-scripting-and-editor-plugins">
		official Grid Framework thread</a> over at the Unity forums. I get an instant
		notification, so I won't miss your post, and the syntax highlighting is better
		for answering questions than other forms of contact. If you are looking for
		the latest news you can visit my <a href="http://unitygridframework.blogspot.com">
		blog</a> or my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/HiPhish">YouTube channel</a>.
