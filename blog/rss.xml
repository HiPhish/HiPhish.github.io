components provided by https://getbootstrap.com/Bootstrap with my own constructs. The menu bar is one
of the larger components I use, it's fairly complex and requires a lot of
non-semantic markup to get working. In this blog post I will describe step by
step how I built mine, which requires less markup and does not rely on
Javascript. You can try the demo.htmldemo to see what we are going for (please resize
your window to see the responsiveness).</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>organisation</category></item><item><title>Neovim channel for GNU Guix</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2019/01/21/neovim-guix-channel/</link><description>I have set up a https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/neovim-guix-channel/channel for https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/GNU Guix to build https://neovim.io/Neovim. This channel serves
as an experimental staging ground for porting Neovim (and perhaps other related
projects in the future) to the Guix functional package manager. When the
packages are deemed stable and correct enough they will be submitted to Guix
proper.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2019 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>vim</category></item><item><title>Introducing Quicklisp.nvim</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/quicklisp.nvim/</link><description>One of the new features of https://neovim.io/Neovim is its ability to write plugins in any
programming language, provided that there is a plugin host available. I have
wanted to play around with the https://github.com/adolenc/cl-neovim/Common Lisp host for a while, and I like for
something useful to come out of it in the end, so I created https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/quicklisp.nvimQuicklisp.nvim, a
plugin which allows users to manage Common Lisp libraries from inside Neovim.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2019 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>vim</category></item><item><title>A new static site generator</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2019/01/15/a-new-ssg/</link><description>Over two years already without rewriting the workshop? I have to rectify this,
with the greatest rewrite yet! I have abandoned Pelican because I constantly
had to adjust things manually after the build process, and even then there were
parts of the website that weren't working. This put me off from blogging, since
after each post I would have to stitch everything back together by hand. Seeing
that no static site generator would be able to meet my needs I decided to
instead write my own in Scheme.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>organisation</category></item><item><title>Goodbye macOS, hello GNU/Linux</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2018/12/01/gnu-linux/</link><description>I knew this day would come eventually, so here we are: I moved from macOS to
GNU/Linux as my operating system. It has been a couple of months since then and
I have settled in pretty comfortably; some things are better some things are
worse, and some things are just plain different.</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>organisation</category></item><item><title>A purely functional fixed timestep loop</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2017/07/16/functional-fixed-timestep-loop/</link><description>There is a great article by Glenn Fiedler titled http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/“Fix Your Timestep!” in
which the author explains various approaches to writing a game loop and
concludes with a loop that provides a fixed time step for simulation. If you
are not familiar with this topic go read the article first and come back later.
The author has written the implementation in C or C++ using a lot of mutation
and looping, so I wanted to give a purely functional approach a shot.</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2017 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>misc</category></item><item><title>Creating a mock REPL on Unix</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2017/05/13/mock-repl-unix/</link><description>During the development of https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/repl.nvim/REPL.nvim I had to be able to test the plugin
without relying on any particular REPL present on the development system. The
solution was to create a mock REPL, a shell script which acts like a really
dumb REPL. Here is the code:</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>misc</category></item><item><title>Introducing REPL.nvim</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2017/05/06/introducing-repl-nvim/</link><description>Integrating a REPL in Vim has been a difficult issue in the past, but with
Nvim's built-in terminal emulator it is just a few commands away. My new
https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/repl.nvim/REPL.nvim plugin now puts the REPL only one command away, for any
programming language you wish. The end goal is to have a complete generic and
configurable REPL framework which can be customised to the needs of any
language and which forms a solid foundation for other plugins as well.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>open-source</category></item><item><title>Outlining of HTML pages is fundamentally broken</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2017/04/25/html-outline-fundamentally-broken/</link><description>If you were to run the Workshop through an HTML validator you would notice a
lot of warnings about the document outline. What is going on here? HTML 5
defines an https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#outlineoutline algorithm which allows browsers and assistive
technologies to create an outline of the page. In theory a blind person could
ask their reader for the outline of the page and get a sort of table of
contents which they could use to quickly jump to a specific part of the page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>misc</category></item><item><title>Introducing info.vim</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2016/11/20/introducing-info.vim/</link><description>There is a new project up at the Workshop: https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/info.viminfo.vim, a Vim plugin which
implements a complete reader and browser for info documents from within Vim.
This is similar to the standalone info program or the Emacs info mode.</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2016 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>vim</category></item><item><title>Rewriting the Workshop</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2016/09/27/rewriting-the-workshop/</link><description>At this point I  could start to make rewriting  my website an annual tradition.
There have been a number of little  details that have been rubbing me the wrong
way for almost a year now;  the biggest one was the navigation bar on sub-sites
like the  Grid Framework  product site.  There were  also accessibility  issues
relating  to  the lack  of a  proper  HTML  document  outline  and  the  use of
JavaScript.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2016 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>organisation</category></item><item><title>Introducing IPS-Tools</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2016/07/06/intro-ips-tools/</link><description>I found myself needing a program to apply binary patches in the IPS file format
and I was really disappointed  that there are no proper  Unix programs for that
purpose available.  So I set out to make my own,  but instead of just  applying
patches it would be a complete suite of tools to handle all IPS-related tasks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2016 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>ips-tools</category></item><item><title>Highlighting `NSImageView` the right way</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2016/06/25/highlighting-nsimageview/</link><description>Recently  I have  been working on  a small Cocoa  app and one  of the  things I
needed to do was highlight an  NSImageView when the user is hovering above it
while dragging a file.  You would think  that it's a very simple task,  and you
would be right, but judging by some of the things on the internet it looks like
an unsolved problem.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2016 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>misc</category></item><item><title>Introducing NTFS-Clone</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2016/05/31/intro-ntfs-clone/</link><description>This is  a very  useful project  I had  written quite  a while  ago at work and
recently found collecting dust on my hard drive. It lets you create perfect 1:1
copies of NTFS hard drives on Unix.  The problem with every software I had come
across was  that it would copy the data,  but that wasn't enough,  so we had to
run Windows repair on every single drive.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2016 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>ntfs-clone</category></item><item><title>Neovim has tab-local working directories now</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2016/04/22/neovim-tcd/</link><description>My Neovim PR to add tab-local working directories has recently been merged.  In
this post I will explain what it does and why you will love it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>open-source</category></item><item><title>Feeds are live now</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2015/11/14/feeds-live-now/</link><description>RSS- and Atom feeds are live now. You can subscribe to an entire blog using the

For that navigate to the category using either the navigator or by clicking the
category button of an article.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>organisation</category></item><item><title>We are live!</title><link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2015/11/11/we-are-live/</link><description>The Workshop blog is finally up and running, in all its static glory. This
makes the site practically complete, at least as complete as a website can ever
be anyway. It also works great with my
https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/Multiblog-PelicanMultiblog
plugin.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><category>organisation</category></item></channel></rss>
