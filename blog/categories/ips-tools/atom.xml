and I was really disappointed  that there are no proper  Unix programs for that
purpose available.  So I set out to make my own,  but instead of just  applying
patches it would be a complete suite of tools to handle all IPS-related tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/IPS-Tools"&gt;IPS-Tools&lt;/a&gt; is the result, it consists of three standalone CLI programs, one CLI
program that acts as an entry point to the suite, and a C library for inclusion
in other applications. There are three programs because I have identified three
problem domains: applying a patch, generating a patch and examining a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools are all written in C99 using only the standard library, they are tiny
and  should  run  on  pretty  much  anything.  Great  for  embedding  in  other
applications.  In fact,  I have a  GUI frontend that  uses the library  to give
users a drag &amp;amp; drop interface, but it still needs some more polish before I can
release it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity  to write a complete specification  of the IPS file
format, because all I was able to find have been bits and pieces everywhere and
only closed-source programs, so I had to piece things together. IPS is a fairly
simple format,  but it  has some  hairy corners  because over  time people have
added  extensions  to it  (compressed records  and truncation).  With IPS-tools
there is a complete  file specification and  a reference implementation  freely
available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
