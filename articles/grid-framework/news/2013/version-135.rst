Grid Framework version 1.3.5 has been approved last week, here is the
changelog:

- Added a new event for when the grid changes in such a way that if would need
  to be redrawn.
- Some of the exmples were broken when Unity updated to version 4.3, now they
  should be working again.
- Overhauled the undo system for the grid align panel to remove the now
  obsolete Unity undo methods.

I promised I would be working on Playmaker support, so what's going on here? I
have been bogged down a lot with studies and real life stuff oder the last
months (nothing bad though, don't worry), so things were going slowly, but they
were moving. The current problem is Playmaker itself; from what I have used it
is a fantastic system to crate game logic and totally worth it, however, when
it comes to extending it things aren't that nice anymore.

I am in contact with a staff member who is helping me out, so I'm not entirely
reliant on the lackluster documentation, but there is a lot of ugly code
redundancy that cannot be avoided. I'm still working on it and it will come out
eventually, but it will take more time. How much? I don't really know, it
depends on how rigid or flexible Playmaker turns out to be.
