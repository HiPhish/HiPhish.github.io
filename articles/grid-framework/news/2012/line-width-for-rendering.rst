I just submitted version 1.1.1 (*update: has been approved*) which lets you set
the width of the rendered line in the inspector. Here is an example, obviously
it's over the top, but you can set the width to anything you like.

Now I just need to provide a nice function to pass rendering points to
Vectrosity. I'm sure those of you who own a Vectrosity license would like to be
able to combine the best of both. I promise when I'm done it will be the last
time you'll see me talk about rendering for a while.
