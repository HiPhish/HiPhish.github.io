Version 1.7.0 of Grid Framework has just been approved by the Asset Store team.
This release brings some more love for hexagonal grids in the form of two new
coordinate systems and four new rendering shapes.

The new coordinate systems are the downwards herringbone coordinate system
where every second column is shifted down- instead of upwards and the downwards
rhombic coordinate system where each successive column is shifted one hex down-
instead of upwards.

Two of the new rendering shapes are downwards rectangle and downwards rhombus
to go with the new coordinate systems. The two completely new rendering shapes
are the up- and downwards herringbone grids. Unlike the other shapes these ones
are continuous and expand smoothly.

Notice how the grid on the left-had side shifts ever odd column upwards and the
grid on the right-had side shifts ever odd column downwards.

Here is the full change log:

- *New:* Downwards herringbone coordinate system for hex grids
- *New:* Downwards rectangle rendering shape to accompany the new coordinate system.
- *New:* Downwards rhombic coordinate system.
- *New:* Downwards rhombic rendering shape to accompany the new coordinate system.
- *New:* Up- and downwards herringbone rendering shape.
- *Fixed:* The grid align panel now correctly respect or ignores rotation when aligning.
